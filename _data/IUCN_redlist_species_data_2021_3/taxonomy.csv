Although evidence was not given to support this statement, Bernardes <em>et al.</em> (2005) followed Soto’s proposal. However, later studies have re-evaluated the species’ validity. The validity of <em>S. occulta</em> Vooren and da Silva, 1991 as a distinct species has been confirmed through the study of mitochondrial DNA by Stelbrink <em>et al.</em> (2010) and in a comparative study of Southwest Atlantic <em>Squatina</em> neurocrania (Carvalho <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;Both studies also recognized <em>S. argentina</em>, <em>S. guggenheim</em>, and <em>S. occulta</em> as the only valid species in the Southwest Atlantic (preceding the description of new species since that time, <em>S. david </em>and <em>S. varii</em>).<br/><br/>Some confusion exists regarding the publication date of the description of&#160;<em>S. occulta</em> (Faria <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some taxonomic literature sources list 1991 as the publication date while others list 1992. This confusion is probably due to the distribution of pre-prints of the article in 1991 before the full issue of the journal was printed in 1992. According to The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the publication date of the <em>S. occulta</em> description is 1991. There has also been discrepancy in referencing the species authority for&#160;<em>S. occulta</em>, particularly the name of the second author (Faria <em>et al. </em>2014); K.G. da Silva’s surname has been spelled ‘da Silva’, ‘Da Silva’, and ‘Silva’. Faria <em>et al.</em> (2014) suggested using the one in the revisions by Vaz and Carvalho (2013) and in online taxonomic databases.

No subspecies are recognized. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that populations in different ocean basins do not represent distinct clades, but some maternal lineages can be traced back across hemispheric boundaries, indicating some level of inter-hemispheric gene flow, perhaps in the distant past (Baker <em>et al</em>. 1994).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population structure</span><br/></p><p>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) currently recognizes four breeding stocks around the South Pacific and Australia based on Discovery mark recoveries, demographic isolation, and genetic differentiation (Olavarria <em>et al</em>. 2007):</p>   <ul><li>1 north of feeding area IV (referred to as Stock D including Western   Australia),</li><li>1 north of feeding Area V (referred to as Stock E including Eastern Australia, New Caledonia and Tonga),</li><li>1 north of feeding Area VI (Stock F including Cook Islands and French Polynesia), and</li><li>1 north of feeding Area I (Stock G including Colombia).</li></ul>            <p>The IWC also recognizes further stock sub-division of breeding stock E and F into sub-stocks supported by demographic isolation and genetic differentiation (Olavarria <em>et al</em>. 2006). Breeding stock E is sub-divided into E1 (Eastern Australia), E2 (New  Caledonia) and E3 (Tonga) and breeding stock F into F1 (Cook Islands) and F2 (French  Polynesia). These breeding stocks are shown in Figure 1 (see Supplementary Material). We use the terminology breeding stock (e.g. D, E, F, G) to refer to breeding stocks based on demographic isolation and genetic differentiation, and sub-stock to refer to sub-divisions within these breeding stocks, as currently recognized by the IWC&#160; (e.g., E1, E2, E3, F1, F2).</p><p><br/></p>     <p>&#160;Olavarria <em>et al</em>. (2007) found significant differentiation of maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt) DNA at both the haplotype and nucleotide level (F<sub>ST</sub><em> </em>= 0.033; Φ<sub>ST</sub><em> </em>= 0.022), between breeding stocks D, G and four of the Oceania sub-stocks (E2, E3, F1, F2). When sub-stock E1 is included in this comparison (Olavarria <em>et al</em>. (2006)), the estimated differentiation among stocks by F<sub>ST</sub> is ~0.02. Based on standard population genetic models (e.g. ,Wright 1978, Waples &amp;&#160;Gaggiotti 2006), F<sub>ST</sub> values of 0.01 correspond to approximately 25 migrant individuals per generation (or less than one migrant individual per year in the case of Humpback Whales and other long lived mammals). These breeding stock boundaries, and the sub-stocks within them, are also supported by the analysis of movements by individuals based on photo-identification and microsatellite genotyping (DNA profiling).</p><p><br/></p>     <p>An extensive comparison of photo-identification catalogues by sub-stock found only four matches between the migratory corridor of East Australia (E1 represented by Hervey Bay and Byron Bay, with a catalogue size of 1,242 individuals) and breeding grounds in Oceania (E2, E3, F1 and F2, with a catalogue size of 679 individuals) (Garrigue <em>et al</em>. 2007). This level of interchange is surprisingly small, given the relatively large catalogues used in the comparison, and provides strong evidence for sub-division within breeding stock E (Garrigue <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p><p><br/></p>     <p>An additional photo-identification comparison among regions of Oceania (E2, E3, F1 and F2 with a combined catalogue size of 679) documented 20 records of interchange, mostly between neighbouring regions (Garrigue <em>et al</em>. 2006). Overall, the limited movement of individuals between adjacent sites within Oceania is consistent with the significant (but low) level of differentiation observed in mtDNA from these regions (Olavarria <em>et al.</em> 2007) and suggests that humpback whales wintering in E2, E3, F1 and F2 are demographically independent and should be recognized as individual management stocks (Garrigue <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>     <p><br/>Comparisons of historical sighting data and whaling records (Dawbin 1956, 1959, 1964) with recent sighting survey data from New Zealand, Fiji and Norfolk Island demonstrate a lack of (or at the very least a slow) recovery at these sites (Childerhouse and Gibbs 2006, Gibbs <em>et al</em>. 2006, Paton <em>et al</em>. 2006, Oosterman and Whicker 2008). These surveys returned to the same look-out sites used by Dawbin and replicated his earlier surveys as closely as possible. Results from these re-surveys include (i) sighting rates in Fiji over the period 1956-58 were between 0.15-0.58 whales per hour and were significantly higher than equivalent sighting rates observed of between 0.01-0.03 in 2002-03 (Paton <em>et al</em>. 2006) and, (ii) surveys in New Zealand indicate that between 2004-2006 sightings were 29% of what there were in 1960 (Childerhouse and Gibbs 2006). It is important to note that the baseline data for these surveys in the 1950s and 1960s were from populations that had already been whaled for more than 50 years. It is not possible to directly assess the rates of increase for these sites but what is clear is that any population increases appear to be lacking or very low. In contrast, the East Australian stock is increasing at 10-11% per annum (Noad <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p><p><br/></p>     <p>These indications of demographic independence are likely sufficiently strong to provide evidence for further subpopulations within the Oceania, however, such partitioning presents difficulties in assessing population status (discussed below) that have not been overcome at present. Furthermore, problems with the allocation of commercial catches on the feeding grounds to the appropriate sub-stock breeding area make the assessment even more challenging. Given that it is not possible to assess the status of each sub-stock, we have therefore used a model that can assess the South Pacific as though it is a single stock (i.e., E and F).</p>   <p><br/></p><p>In conclusion, the presently recognized IWC stock and sub-stock boundaries are consistent with available evidence. With respect to the South Pacific, the relevant sub-stock divisions are East Australia (E1), New Caledonia (E2), Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2), and Colombia (G). The taxon assessed here is, therefore, called the Oceania subpopulation, which consists of IWC breeding stocks E and F as a distinct subpopulation of Humpback Whales. It should be identified separately based on population isolation and a demonstrated high level of depletion (see below). We propose this subpopulation specifically for the purposes of the IUCN threat ranking process as it is consistent with the existing IWC recognized breeding stock boundaries.</p>"

However, comparative analyses using skull morphometrics (Amaha 1994), nine microsatellite DNA loci, and mitochondrial DNA (Rosel <em>et al.&#160;</em>1994, Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that differences do exist between Black Sea and Mediterranean Common dolphins, even though significant differentiation was not evident due to small sample sizes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, based on another mitochondrial DNA study, differentiation was not observed between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea populations of the species (Tonay<em> et al. </em>2020). Contrary to what was previously thought, it seems likely that gene flow between the Black and Mediterranean Seas is existent and not rare through the Turkish Straits System (TSS). It will be necessary to perform genetic research on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA with a greater number of samples, and complement these with morphological analyses to better understand the phylogeny and genetic connectivity between subpopulations of <em>D. delphis</em>."

There is no geographical overlap with either the Okhotsk Sea or the East Greenland–Svalbard–Barents Sea subpopulations, which are assessed separately. Bockstoce and Burns (1993) suggested some movement of Bowheads between the BCB area and the eastern Canadian Arctic based on two whaling irons found in whales taken in the Chukchi Sea that apparently came from ships that only hunted in the northwestern Atlantic. However, according to Givens <em>et al</em>. (2010) “the degree of genetic mixing has been extremely small” between these two regions. Based on mtDNA and single nucleotide polymorphisms, Baird <em>et al</em>. (2018) found clear genetic differentiation between BCB and Okhotsk Sea Bowheads, and less clear, but statistically significant, differentiation between BCB Bowheads and those Bowheads sampled in the eastern Canadian Arctic.

Thus, we recognize six species of <em>Capricornis</em>:  <br/> <br/>• <em>C. crispus</em> (Japanese Serow, restricted to Japan) <br/>• <em>C. milneedwardsii</em> (Chinese Serow, but also occurring in southeast Asian countries) <br/>• <em>C. rubidus</em> (Red Serow, restricted to Myanmar) <br/>• <em>C. sumatraensis</em> (Sumatran Serow, in Indonesia, Malaysia and southern Thailand) <br/>• <em>C. swinhoei</em> (Formosan Serow, restricted to Taiwan, Province of China) <br/>• <em>C. thar</em> (Himalayan Serow, along the Himalayan range) <br/> <br/>The genus <em>Naemorhedus</em> is recognized as referring to gorals.

Prior to 1998, some authorities considered the Severtzov sheep of Uzbekistan to be urial, but following Bunch <em>et al</em>. (1998), it has generally been included as an argali. One exception is Mitchell and Frisina (2007), who follow some earlier taxonomists in recognizing a separate species <em>O. polii</em>, under which they put a few additional subspecies (see below on subspecific taxonomy). Similarly, the Handbook of the Mammals of the World (Valdez and Weinberg 2011) splits argali into nine separate species.<br/> <br/> Argali live over a vast geographic range, but are separated into more-or-less disjunct populations, some of which are morphologically identifiable. How much (if any) of the taxon’s disjunct distribution is natural and how much the result of anthropogenic influence causing range area fragmentation remains open to debate. Similarly, how (and even whether) various populations should be classified as subspecies remains contentious. Wilson and Reeder (2005) and Fedosenko and Blank (2005) recognize nine subspecies: <em>O. a. ammon</em>, <em>O. a. collium</em>, <em>O. a. comosa</em> (= <em>jubata</em>), <em>O. a. darwini</em>, <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>, <em>O. a. karelini</em>, <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>, <em>O. a. polii</em>, and <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>. Geist (1991) recognized all of these except <em>collium</em> and <em>severtzovi</em> (which at the time was still considered an urial); he also considered that <em>jubata</em> had precedence over <em>comosa</em>. Shackleton and Lovari (1997) followed Geist’s (1991) classification except for adding <em>collium</em> as a valid subspecies. Within China, some authors have recognized additional subspecies. Wang (2002) recognized <em>O. a. littledalei, adametzi</em>, and <em>sairensis</em> (all within the range occupied by <em>karelini</em> or <em>collium</em> by the above authorities), and <em>dalailamae</em> (within the range occupied by <em>hodgsoni</em>, above) in addition to <em>ammon</em> and <em>darwini</em> (but did not recognize <em>O. a. jubata</em>). Yu (2001) recognized <em>dalailamae</em> as distinct from <em>hodgsoni</em>, but did not recognize the subdivisions within <em>karelini</em> or <em>collium</em> (and also did not recognize <em>jubata</em>). Mitchell and Frisina (2007) recognized <em>ammon, darwini, jubata, dalailamae</em>, and <em>hodgsoni</em> (as well as <em>karelini, nigrimontana</em>, and <em>severtzovi</em> under <em>O. polii</em>). Recent genetic studies (Tserenbataa 2003 and Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. 2004), based on mtDNA analysis, questioned the validity of separating Altai argali <em>O. a. ammon</em> and Gobi Argali or Mongolian Argali <em>O. a. darwini</em> within Mongolian populations and suggest that all Argali in Mongolia may represent one single subspecies. There is uncertainty regarding the subspecific status of argali in Gansu and adjacent Inner Mongolia; there are also differing opinions regarding the morphometric and/or geographic separation between <em>polii</em> and <em>karelini</em>. Future genetic work, similarly to Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Wu <em>et al</em>. (2003), may suggest or reject the hypothesis that clinal, rather than threshold variation characterizes many argali populations. More research is required to clarify the taxonomy of the species. </p>  <p>The International Single Species Action Plan for the Conservation of Argali under the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS 2014) follows the IUCN SSC Caprinae Specialist Group and recognizes the following nine subspecies:</p>  <em>Ovis ammon ammon,&#160;</em>Altai Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon collium,&#160;</em>Kazakhstan Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon darwini,&#160;</em>Gobi Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon hodgsoni,&#160;</em>Tibetan Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon jubata,&#160;</em>North China Argali, Shansi Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon karelini,&#160;</em>Tian Shan Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon nigrimontana,&#160;</em>Karatau Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon polii, </em>Marco Polo Sheep, Pamir Argali<br/> <em>Ovis ammon severtzovi,&#160;</em>Severtzov’s Argali<br/> <br/> Because subspecific taxonomy remains unresolved, most subspecies that are recognized cross international borders, and the species occurs in many countries with differing management regimes, this account treats <em>Ovis ammon</em> by country (and, where appropriate, by population) rather than by subspecies"

Considering these two taxa as distinct species would be coherent with the morphological and genetic differences between them, as well as, their past evolutionary divergence, and the occurrence of a hybrid zone (Rezaei <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>The name <em>O. orientalis</em> has first been used to designate the hybrid Red Sheep, found in Iran (listed as <em>O. o. orientalis</em> on page 13 of the IUCN Caprinae Action Plan). This sheep is considered a hybrid form, the result of interbreeding of Mouflon and Urial. Therefore, the name <em>O. orientalis</em> is <em>nomen nudum</em>. Following on chronology, the next valid name for the Asiatic Mouflon should be <em>O.</em> <em>gmelini</em> Blyth, 1841; and for the Urial it is <em>O.</em> <em>vignei</em> Blyth, 1841. Both CITES and the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) use <em>O. gmelini</em> for Mouflon and <em>O. vignei</em> for the Urial.<br/><br/>There are three to five autochthonous wild subspecies of Mouflon (IUCN/SSC Caprinae Specialist Group 2000): Armenian Mouflon <em>O. g.</em> <em>gmelini</em>, and two subspecies restricted to Iran: <em>O. g.</em> <em>isphahanica</em>, the Esfahan Mouflon and <em>O. g.</em> <em>laristanica</em>, the Laristan Mouflon. Sometimes the Anatolian Mouflon <em>O. g. anatolica</em> and the Armenian mouflon <em>O. g. armeniana</em> are considered as subspecies separate from <em>O. g. gmelini</em>. However, we follow the former classification of Mouflon subspecies in this assessment (IUCN/SSC Caprinae Specialist Group 2000).<br/><br/>The Cyprus Mouflon, introduced in prehistoric times, might be a separate subspecies <em>O. g. ophion</em>. “Wild sheep” found on Mediterranean islands are generally recognized to have been introduced by humans (Shackleton 1997, Masseti 1998, Wilson and Reeder 2005), and genetic and archaeo-zoological studies suggest that they are feral populations of ancient domestic stocks (e.g., Vigne 1994, Hiendleder <em>et al</em>. 2002). Consequently, such taxa should be included in the respective domestic species (<em>O. aries</em>) (Gentry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Gentry <em>et al.</em> 2004, Gippoliti and Amori 2004) and not as subspecies of the wild taxon <em>O. gmelini</em>. However, Cyprus Mouflon, in contrast to Corsican and Sardinian mouflons, may originate from introduced wild stock, Iran representing the most credited region as the source for its ancient introduction to Cyprus, and thus not be a feral sheep (Guerrini <em>et al</em>. 2015). Also, Sanna <em>et al</em>. (2015) noted high genetic distance observed between the Cyprus mouflon and other (domestic) sheep haplogroups, including European, Corsican and Sardinian mouflons, but found the Cyprus Mouflon grouping exclusively with Anatolian Mouflon <em>O. g. gmelini [anatolica]</em>. Hiendleder <em>et al</em>. (2002) suggested that likely candidates for truly wild ancestors of domestic sheep are mouflon populations found in Turkey and western Iran; thus genetic differentiation of feral descendants of early domesticated from descendants of true wild sheep is difficult. Therefore, we include <em>O. g. ophion </em>in this assessment, because of being possibly a wild, but not a feral sheep.</p>"

The first available name is <em>Caninmuntiacus truongsonensis</em> [Pham Mong] Giao, [Do] Tuoc, Eric [Wikramanayake], [Vu Van] Dung <em>et al</em>. in Nguyen An Quang Ha, 1997, in a newspaper article. This meets all International Code for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) criteria for availability (Grubb 2005) and therefore by the ICZN principle of priority must stand as the valid name for this taxon, unless an earlier available name is found. The following year, <em>Muntiacus truongsonensis</em> P.M. Giao, D. Tuoc, V.V. Dung, Wikramanayake, Amato, Arctander and Mackinnon, 1998 was proposed, explicitly as a new name (not as a clarification of the earlier name). This 1998 proposal is certainly based on the same collected material as the 1997 proposal so is a junior objective synonym of the latter. As the species-group name is spelled exactly the same way as in the 1997 proposal, it is also a junior homonym of it. Neither original description allows objective morphological determination of what the name applies to, although mtDNA sequences shared with no previously-named muntjac were isolated from the material collected (P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. 1998). The 1997 publication indicated no holotype, and gave no details on where the syntypes were or would be lodged. The 1998 publication of the junior synonym named a holotype; Grubb (2005) considered that “technically it is probably a lectotype”. In fact, as the 1998 publication was explicitly proposing a new name, not a reinterpretation of the 1997 name, the holotype designated is indeed the holotype, but of their junior synonym; it could have no bearing on the 1997 name <em>Caninmuntiacus truongsonensis</em>, the senior (and thus valid) name for this group, unless an explicit nomenclatural act were to associate the specimen with that name, as a lectotype (there appears no doubt that the 1998 holotype is from the syntype series in the 1997 original description). Such an act would be unwise, because the specimen may not now be traceable, and in any case is not known to have been the source of the DNA result and it has no pelage associated with it, nor might it be a complete skull with all relevant diagnostic features present. Therefore, to make this single specimen the name-bearing type would handicap progress in resolving this name’s applicability and if it were found to have different DNA, would firmly install even more confusion. Nomenclatural stability, and thus conservation, would best be served by designating as a neotype a specimen (ideally full skeletal and pelt) lodged in a named internationally accessible collection with long-term storage facilities, which shares the exact genetic sequence provided in the 1998 description of the junior synonym. There is currently no known specimen suitable for this course of events.  <br/> <br/>Some of the biological material referred to in the articles of Nguyen An Quang Ha (1997) and P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) was shown in 1998 to R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) by Do Tuoc in the collections of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute, Hanoi. This material, consisting entirely of damaged skulls and mandibles, is poorly, although distinctively, labelled. Part of the explanation for the confusion over application of the name results from it including at least two species: one or more taxa in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex and one specimen of northern red muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>. The three specimens illustrated in Nguyen An Quang Ha (1997) and several other newspapers and magazines were not present in this FIPI collection. Several years later, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) came across them in the WWF offices in Hanoi, where they appear to have been since 1997. None of either the FIPI or WWF material is labelled as any form of type, or has the markings as described in P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998). Until a lectotype or neotype of <em>C. truongsonensis</em> P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. in Nguyen An Quang Ha, 1997 is established in an explicit nomenclatural act, it is not possible to begin to determine the diagnostic morphological characters of <em>M. truongsonensis</em>. Until such an act it is only speculation whether any or all of the pelage characters or the mtDNA sequences given by P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Amato <em>et al</em>. (1999a, 1999b, 2000), or the skull characteristics of some of the FIPI and WWF material which appear to be significantly different from <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), in fact are those of <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, although with appropriate typification, they could probably be made to be. This uncertainty is because it is effectively impossible that all syntypes (comprising, as they do, 2–3 species) would share the same mtDNA or pelage features with each other, and they certainly do not share skull features. It is not clear whether the genetic analysis of the 1998 publication included the 1998 holotype (for which, as argued above, it would not be sensible to propose formally as the lectotype of the 1997 name), although it seems a reasonable inference that it involved the 1997 syntypes. Until a lectotype or neotype of the 1997 name is selected, it is not possible to assess the possibility that gene sequences published in P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998), and Amato <em>et al</em>. (1999a, 1999b, 2000), could actually refer to a taxon different from those skulls within the syntype series with obviously novel morphological characteristics (which were not discussed in either the 1997 or 1998 publications). This possibility is real, although slight, because of the presence of at least two apparently species-level taxa within the syntype series and the fairly likely sympatric occurrence of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> with the taxon generally taken to be represented by the name <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, or even the possibility of a closely similar taxon (perhaps <em>M. puhoatensis</em>). <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> is morphologically very similar to material currently assumed to represent <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, and an animal very similar in skull and pelage features to the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> has been recorded from the Xe Sap NPA area of Lao PDR, very close to the type locality of <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. obs. based on material collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard). As of November 2015, following visits to both FIPI and the WWF Hanoi offices, it appears that all of the original type material of <em>M. truongsonensis</em> has now been lost (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/> <br/>Although morphological characteristics cannot, therefore, be objectively defined for the presumed taxon to which the name <em>M. truongsonensis</em> is being applied there exist various specimens very similar to, but obviously different from, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. These have generally dark rather than brown or reddish pelage, a tail that is blackish dorsally and long premaxillae that contact the nasals rather than short premaxillae that do not. These are taken here provisionally to represent <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (in the hope that this morphologically-defined group will be found to correspond to the novel genetic sequence of P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. 1998, and that appropriate typification could cement this hypothesis). However, there is still considerable variation in these morphological traits within available Indochinese specimens of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex, and some animals show character states apparently intermediate between <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and '<em>M. truongsonensis</em>'. It is not clear whether these represent hybrids or indicate that intraspecific variation is wide enough to blur interspecific variation, because very few complete specimens are available for which congruence between morphological traits can be compared: in fact out of over 50 specimens of this complex from Lao PDR and Viet Nam, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) is only aware of two complete specimens, in which both skull and pelage features can be fully documented, the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and a female collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard from the Xe Sap NPA area of Lao PDR. <br/> <br/>See also <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> for further complications concerning this species-complex."

Czernay (1987) added the following six subspecies to Cabrera's list: <em> M. a. temama, M. a. cerasina, M. a. reperticia, M. a. americana, M. a. trinitatis</em> and <em>M. a. carrikeri</em>. On the other hand, Thomas (1913) considered <em>M. zetta</em> and <em>M. sheila</em> as species and not subspecies. Allen (1915) corroborated Thomas, and added <em>M. trinitatis, M. rufa, M. sartorii, M. gualea, M. fuscata</em> and <em>M. zamora</em> as species.  <em>M. temama</em>, earlier considered as a subspecies, was reclassified as a separate species by Groves and Grubb (1987), based on cytogenetical studies carried out by other authors. Rossi (2000) did a taxonomic revision of the <em>Mazama</em> genus for Brazil. He did not observe differences between <em>Mazama americana</em> specimens collected from different regions. Cytogenetic analysis of <em>M. americana</em> was initially realized by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (1969), who reported 2n-68 and NF=74. Jorge and Bernirschke (1977) analyzed three <em>M. americana temama</em> and described their basic karyotype as 2n=50 and FN=70, with a chromosome fusion in one of the studied animals. The X chromosome was submetacentric and approximately the same size as chromosome pair 7. The metacentric Y was the smallest chromosome. The vast differences among the animals analyzed by Jorge and Benirschke (1977) and Taylor <em>et al.</em> (1969) raised questions concerning these species’ classification. Neitzel (1987) analyzed a Paraguayan female and described yet another pattern for the species.  It had 2n=52, plus 4 to 5 B chromosomes and NF=56. The submetacentric X was the largest chromosome. These results increased doubts as to this species’ karyotypic pattern. More recently, Duarte (1992) analyzed four Brazilian animals, and obtained conflicting results.  Diploid numbers were 48, 50, 52 and 54, and NF = 54, 54, 56 and 56, respectively. These results were similar to those obtained by Neitzel (1987).  According to Duarte and Merino (1997), this polymorphism appears to indicate the existence of various species within the Red Brocket Deer."

Geist (1998) noted a broad zone of hybridization between the two forms in central and eastern Siberia but Boeskorov (2003) identifies the Yenisei River as the boundary between the ranges of the two putative species. There are no differences in antler morphology on either side of the river, however, suggesting substantial gene flow (Kolesnikov and Kozlovskii 2014). Moreover, genetic analyses have generally supported distinguishing the two at the subspecific level (Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> 2002 a,b; Udina <em>et al.</em> 2002; Hundertmark and Bowyer 2004); further research is needed before a consensus would support species-level classification.<br/><br/>Hundertmark <em>et al.</em> (2002b) report that analysis of mtDNA revealed three haplogroups, one entirely Asian, one primarily European and one primarily North American. Eight extant subspecies are recognised here:<br/><em>A. a. alces</em> - Scandinavia, Finland, Baltic states and Poland E to Yenisei River<br/><em>A. a. americana</em> - E Canada (C Ontario to Newfoundland)<br/><em>A. a. andersoni</em> - British Colombia to Minnesota and Ontario<br/><em>A. a. buturlini</em> - NE Siberia and Kamchatka<br/><em>A. a. cameloides</em> - N Mongolia, Ussuriland, N Manchuria<br/><em>A. a. gigas</em> - Alaska and Yukon<br/><em>A. a. pfizenmayeri</em> - C Siberia and Stanovoy and Cherskiy Mountains<br/><em>A. a. shirasi</em> - S Alberta to Wyoming and Utah"

Two subspecies are generally recognized, the nominate and <em>A. p. annamiticus</em> (type locality in Viet Nam), although there has been no recent re-evaluation, and the relative historical distributions of these subspecies and nature of contact between them, if any, remain unclear (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007).

Assignment of the name to an external morphological diagnosis is problematic because the holotype is an incomplete skull (male) and therefore only those skull characters observable on this specimen are objectively known to be those of the species. Assignment of any further characters, including all relating to pelage, relies on subjective association of other specimens with the name. Although it is almost always justified to assume that a series of specimens of the same general type from the same general area do comprise one species, the confusion into which such assumptions have pitched understanding of muntjac status in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and the apparent sympatry of two or more species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex within this same area, urges a precautionary approach here. Caution is further indicated by results from camera-trapping in and around the type locality, which suggests on the basis of pelage features that there may be more than one species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex in the general area (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Such sympatry would explain certain incongruities such as Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. (1999) apparently having measured, from the same general area, the skulls of a slightly larger form with short premaxillae that are separated from the nasals, as well as the seemingly smaller specimens of the type series which have long premaxillae that contact the nasals (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on type material in ANNH, Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1999). The premaxilla length seems to separate the two nominal species of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and <em>M. truongsonensis</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, indicating that, since both character-states are apparently present in northern Myanmar, there may be two species there, too (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The assumption has been made (including by the original describers) that the name <em>M. putaoensis</em> applies to the animals with a red pelage similar in tone to <em>M. vaginalis</em>, but differing in characters of the head pelage. This however needs additional research to investigate the concordance of skulls showing features of the holotype with their associated pelage characteristics (see above). Camera-trap photographs showing the external diagnostic head-pelage characters alluded to above are taken here as provisionally referring to <em>M. putaoensis</em>. Statements about the species' conservation status hinge on whether the skull-based name <em>M. putaoensis</em> conforms to this suite of pelage characters.<br/><br/>It is also possible that some claims of the species based solely on morphological characteristics might actually refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em> which is morphologically very similar (R.J.

No recent reviewer (e.g. Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986, Grubb 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990) appears to have examined the holotype; even Grubb (1977) had only photographs of the skull on which to work (P. Grubb pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins, 1997). However, with the recent discovery of several muntjac species in nearby parts of southeast Asia, re-examination of the <em>M. feae</em> holotype is needed, to clarify the species' diagnostic characters, and to verify that captive animals in various Thai collections (including the Dusit Zoo) and a few specimens in the Natural History Museum, London (particularly # 24.1.6.2) truly are <em>M. feae</em> (Grubb 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990).<br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb (1990) included, within <em>M. feae</em>, two taxa now known to be different species: <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> and <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. <em>M. feae</em> has also been claimed for eastern Tibet (Xizang autonomous region) and southwestern China (Yunnan Province) (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986). Groves and Grubb (1990) grouped various specimens from this area and northern Myanmar with <em>M. feae</em>, in part pending description of a new taxon that was in progress. Ma <em>et al</em>. (1990) described this new taxon, <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, to which some of the past claims of <em>M. feae</em> can probably be attributed (e.g. material in the NHM, London and the FMNH, Chicago, USA). Although several records refer to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, some literature records (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984; Sokolov 1957) are best treated as unidentifiable <em>Muntiacus</em> sp. because diagnostic details, based on the current understanding of muntjac systematics, are not available. <em>M. feae</em> is still routinely included in the mammalian fauna of China, often without mention of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> (e.g. Sheng and Lu 1990, Zhang 1997, Sheng 1998, Sheng <em>et al</em>. 1999, Wang 2003). The Kunming Institute of Zoology holds several specimens from China labelled as <em>M. feae</em> (W.G. Robichaud <em>in litt.</em>. 1997 to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Huang <em>et al</em>. (2006) provided data on the karyotype of '<em>M. feae</em>' but gave the source of the tissues analysed only as fibroblast cell lines of a male <em>M. feae</em> (KCB 91006) that came from the Kunming Cell Bank. If such a cell line was established from a wild-caught animal in China, then it gives considerable support to the presence of <em>M. feae</em> (or a very similar taxon) in southern China, given the apparent similarity of the Huang <em>et al</em>. (2006) karyotype with that of the <em>M. feae</em> karyotype published by Soma <em>et al</em>. (1987) and Tanomtong <em>et al.</em> (2005), which was based on animals from Thailand. However for the purposes of this assessment, the purported distribution in China is considered hypothetical.<br/> <br/>Tortonese (in Grubb 1977) proposed that the correct spelling of the specific name should be <em>M. feai</em> and not <em>M. feae</em>. However, this is not so (Brandon-Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dubois 2007): the correct original spelling of <em>feae</em> should be used, as it was by Corbet and Hill (1992) and Grubb (2005)."
13928,Muntiacus rooseveltorum,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,rooseveltorum,,,,,"Osgood, 1932","The taxonomic status of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> has been controversial for over 60 years, and the species was even relegated by Groves and Grubb (1990) to the synonymy of <em>M. feae</em>. However, genetic analysis of the holotype (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999a,b, 2000; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014a) and morphological investigations (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015) confirm the species' validity with respect to all previously-named taxa. More complex is its relationship with several subsequently proposed names, <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, <em>M. putaoensis</em>, and <em>M. puhoatensis</em>. <br/><br/><em>M. rooseveltorum</em> forms a clade with <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em> supported genetically (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999b, 2000; James <em>et al.</em> 2008; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014 a, b) and morphologically, by the presence of the combination of well developed canines in females and small, generally unbranched, but regularly shed, antlers in males (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The nominal taxon <em>M. puhoatensis</em> is also very likely to belong to this clade (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It is still unclear how many species-level taxa there are in this clade, here referred to as the <em>M. r</em>ooseveltorum species-complex (because <em>rooseveltorum </em>is the earliest available name within the complex). At present, diagnostic characters for individual taxa are limited to base sequences of four genes, although for <em>M. puhoatensis</em> even this is not available (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999b, 2000); the dangers inherent in using mtDNA data to determine taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among closely related populations urge caution in drawing firm conclusions without establishing congruence with variation of nuclear DNA (both autosomal and Y-chromosome) and morphological characters (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). No such analysis has been performed within this species-complex. Neither the congruence of various morphological features speculated to be important in identifying species within this complex, nor the variation in each character within each apparent species, have been analysed: too few specimens exist for such an analysis. Specimens are particularly few, which allow the full set of skull and pelage characters to be assessed, and where skull and skin are known to be from the same original animal. The accounts for <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. puhoatensis</em> (described from one frontlet [antlers and a bit of the skull] lacking any morphological characteristics likely to be necessary for species diagnosis within this species-complex) consider some linked taxonomic and nomenclatorial ambiguities specific to the application of those two names which in turn affect application of the name <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. Synonymy of either or both <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. puhoatensis</em> with <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> cannot be ruled out, although one or both could be valid species. <br/><br/>Le <em>et al.</em> (2014a) reported <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> from the Pu Hoat and Xuan Lien Nature Reserves of Vietnam on the basis of the 16s mitochondrial gene, analysed from four specimens; the paper also claimed to have confirmed the identification on the basis of other mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes, but these apparently have never been determined for the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> holotype, and furthermore the paper presents no data to support the claim that nuclear genes provide taxonomic resolution of the sampled specimens’ identities. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014 b) report nine cytochrome b sequences from samples collected in Xuan Lien NR as analogous to <em>M. rooseveltorum. </em>Neither paper lists actual details of the sources of their sequences, and the sample numbers given in each paper follow different formats, leaving it uncertain as to whether some of the samples are common to both studies. The reported locality of the Pu Hoat samples however is close to if not the same as the type locality of <em>M. puhoatensis</em>, a species undiagnosable at present because the type material is fragmentary, lacking any known diagnostic features, and has also never been genetically analysed with certainty (Minh Le Duc pers. comm. 2015, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Two relatively complete muntjac specimens from the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex from the Pu Hoat region seen by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2015) had several morphological characteristics at variance with the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> suggesting that the identification of muntjac specimens from the Pu Hoat region should be taken with care, until identification can be corroborated by additional evidence including morphology and nuclear DNA (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Several popular media articles that reported the findings of Le <em>et al.</em> (2014) also included camera-trap photographs from Xuan Lien Nature Reserve purported to show <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>; however the muntjacs visible in these photographs were either certainly identifiable as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or unidentifiable to species as they lacked visible diagnostic characteristics.<br/><br/>The animals of northern Myanmar taken to be <em>M. putaoensis</em> shows pelage similarities to <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> sensu stricto, specifically reduced dark frontal stripes, short rather than long crown hair tuft and generally rather uniform, and pale, body and tail pelage. There are several camera-trap photographs of animals from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (outside the presumed range of <em>M. putaoensis</em>) of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>-type animals which show pelage of pale sandy brown to darker orange similar to that shown by animals of northern Myanmar believed to be <em>M. putaoensis </em>(R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <em>M. putaoensis</em> is generally assumed to be geographically isolated from<em> M. rooseveltorum</em>, and current known localities are indeed widely disjunct. However, the lack of known specimens in intervening areas would be expected given the paucity of suitable surveys. The Mekong is a geographical barrier to some mammals (e.g. squirrels; Timmins and Duckworth 2008), but not others, especially geographically and altitudinally wider ranging taxa in the northern highlands north to the headwater areas of China (e.g. the gibbon <em>Hylobates </em>(<em>Nomascus</em>) <em>leucogenys</em>). Given its altitudinal and geographic range, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> is likely to belong in the latter category. <br/><br/>These uncertainties mean that <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> can be considered to be currently known only with certainty from the holotype. One further specimen from the Xe Sap National Protected Area of South Laos with skin and skull is very likely to belong to this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on material collected by R. Steinmetz and Tanya Chanard). A number of other specimens (poorly documented with respect to morphological features and in the case of Lao specimens also provenance) which have been reported to share the same mitochondrial DNA sequences as the holotype (Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999a; Le <em>et al.</em> 2014 a,b) are also likely to belong to the species, but two closely related species might not be diagnosable with respect to their mtDNA (Ballard and Whitlock 2004), as exemplified by the analogous case of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and <em>M. crinifrons</em> (see Red List account for <em>M. gongshanensis</em>). Numerous camera-trap photographs from several sites in both Laos and Vietnam show features consistent with the Holotype, yet because of the cautions as laid out above it is best to treat these as only provisional records of the species at present.<br/><br/>Würster-Hill and Seidel (1985) claimed to have analysed the karyotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, but given the lack of information on the source of their specimen and the means by which it was identified as <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, and the similarities in karyotype with northern red muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>, it has generally been assumed that their tissue originated from a specimen of <em>M. vaginalis</em> (e.g., Groves and Grubb 1990). <br/><br/>Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) listed <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> for China (seemingly for the first time) with the following statement '<em>M. lachrymans</em> teesdalei described by Lydekker (1915) as having relatively small preorbital pit and premaxillae separated from nasals should be <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>'. Although Lydekker's animal is definitely <em>M. reevesi</em>, Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) were correct in <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> having the said features. Thus, some records identified as <em>M. reevesi</em> teesdalei in southern China may in fact not be of that taxon and could, given the features of this 1986 description, refer to animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum </em>complex. Presence of the species-complex in southern China is extremely likely as specimens and photographs of animals in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been obtained close to the Chinese border (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Ma <em>et al.</em> (1986) also identified four purchased skins of this species in the Kunming Institute of Zoology as this species, but the identification was revised to <em>M. reevesi </em>by Groves and Grubb (1990) who apparently examined the four skins in the Kunming Institute of Zoology. There is no description of the skins in the above sources, and given the current understanding of muntjac systematics it would likely be hard to diagnose the specific identity of the skins (especially if heads and tails were incomplete or missing) without molecular analysis, their species identity is thus probably best treated as indeterminate at present. <br/><br/>The English name Roosevelt’s Muntjac is often used, but the scientific name is in the genitive plural, and the original account (Osgood 1932) makes clear that both Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt are to be commemorated. Hence, the appropriate English name is Roosevelts’ Muntjac."
13926,Muntiacus gongshanensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,gongshanensis,,,,,"Ma in Ma, Wang &amp; Shi, 1990","Existing literature is inconsistent regarding the species of muntjac, additional to Northern Red Muntjac <em>M. vaginalis</em>, in eastern Tibet and Yunnan Province (southwestern China) and northern Myanmar, with reports of <em>M. feae</em> (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986), <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986) and <em>M. reevesi</em> (Groves and Grubb 1990) made. In all cases identification criteria remain equivocal and are often not stated. Ma (in Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990) described a new species from this region, <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, to which some past claims of the aforementioned other species can probably be attributed. More recently, <em>M. crinifrons</em> has also been said to occur in this area, which lies far from its generally accepted range (in south-east China; e.g. Lu and Sheng 1984), but this stems entirely from a decision, based upon a similarity of analysed portions of mtDNA, to consider <em>M. gongshanensis</em> indistinguishable from, and therefore a junior synonym of, <em>M. crinifrons</em>, rather than any evidence that <em>M. crinifrons</em>, and specifically not <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, is in the region. The first report was from north Myanmar (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amato <em>et al</em>. 1999b, 2000), which led to this claim that <em>M. gongshanensis</em> is indistinguishable from <em>M. crinifrons</em>; but to thereby consider the two as synonymous ignores the cautions and dangers of relying solely upon mtDNA to determine species phylogenies and identifications (see Ballard and Whitlock 2004, and references therein). Specifically, no consideration was given to possibilities that non-conspecific populations might possess very similar, perhaps identical, mtDNA, although there are several reasons why they sometimes do so (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). There are subsequent reports of muntjacs under the name '<em>M. crinifrons</em>' from areas of China adjacent to north Myanmar and some way to the west (Schaller and Rabinowitz 2004, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007). The identification in Chen <em>et al</em>. (2007) was based explicitly solely on mtDNA and <em>M. gongshanensis</em> may not have been considered (the name <em>M. gongshanensis</em> was associated with the name 'Roosevelt’s Muntjak' [sic], for which the code 'Mgon'; was used; yet no result was given anywhere for 'Mgon', nor is either species discussed); Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004) simply took <em>M. gongshanensis</em> as a synonym of <em>M. crinifrons</em>. Therefore, none of these identifications can be taken as indicative of <em>M. crinifrons</em>, if <em>M. gongshanensis</em> is considered a distinct species (as it is here).<br/> <br/>There is no compelling evidence to treat <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and <em>M. crinifrons</em> as conspecific: the two differ substantially in morphological characters (Ma <em>et al</em>. 1990, Groves and Grubb 1990, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), reportedly also in karyotype (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2006) and even in mtDNA (Lan <em>et al</em>. 1995, Wang Wen and Lan Hong 2000). Nor, because none of the recent records from the region has explicitly identified <em>M. crinifrons</em> as distinct from <em>M. gongshanensis</em> using any of these features, is there even the most slender of reasons to consider that <em>M. crinifrons</em> occurs in the region in addition to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. All available specimens of this sort of muntjac from Myanmar at the Natural History Museum (London; NHM) and the Field Museum (Chicago, USA; FMNH) and camera-trap photographs (WCS Myanmar Programme unpublished data) with diagnostic characters visible agree with the type material of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> as assessed by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008), using data on <em>M. gongshanensis</em> types provided by W.G. Robichaud during a visit to the Kunming Institute of Zoology (Yunnan, China) and from images of the holotype shortly after capture supplied by Lan Hong. These Myanmar records are all treated here as being of <em>M. gongshanensis</em>. Over most of the wider area very little camera trapping has been carried out and specimens are not available; so it cannot be excluded that additional muntjac taxa occur, potentially even perhaps <em>M. crinifrons</em> itself.  <br/> <br/>Several authors have listed <em>M. feae</em> for eastern Tibet (Xizang autonomous region) and southwestern China (Yunnan Province) (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Ma <em>et al</em>. 1986), and Groves and Grubb (1990) grouped various specimens from this area and northern Myanmar (most likely to be <em>M. gongshanensis</em> on current taxonomy) with <em>M. feae</em> pending description of a new taxon, which they were aware was soon to be forthcoming (i.e. <em>M. gongshanensis</em>). The Kunming Institute of Zoology also has several specimens from this area labelled as <em>M. feae</em> (W.G. Robichaud <em>in litt.</em> to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although several of these records refer clearly to <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, some others (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Sokolov 1957, Wirth and Groves 1988) are probably still better treated as unidentifiable <em>Muntiacus</em> sp. because diagnostic details, based on the current understanding of muntjac systematics, are not available. <em>M. feae</em> is still, however, routinely included in the mammalian fauna of China, often without mention of <em>M. gongshanensis</em> (e.g. Zhang <em>et al</em>. 1997, Sheng <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Presumed NHM and FMNH specimens of <em>M. gongshanensis </em>from Myanmar were seemingly identified as “Chinese Muntjac” by Dollman (1932). Grubb (2005) considered the skin from Tang Me in Po Me, Tibet, described by Bailey (1914, 1915) as “<em>M.

They stem largely from a decision, based upon a similarity of analysed portions of mtDNA, to consider M<em>. gongshanensis </em>to be indistinguishable from, and therefore a junior synonym of, <em>M.</em> <em>crinifrons</em>, rather than any evidence that <em>M</em>. <em>crinifrons</em>, and specifically not M. gongshanensis, is in these areas. The first report was from northern Myanmar (Rabinowitz <em>et al.</em> 1998; Amato <em>et al.</em> 1999, 2000), which led to this claim that <em>M</em>. <em>gongshanensis </em>is indistinguishable from <em>M</em>. <em>crinifrons</em>. But to thereby consider the two as synonymous ignores the cautions and dangers of relying solely upon mtDNA to determine species phylogenies and identifications (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). Specifically, no consideration was given to possibilities that non-conspecific populations might possess very similar, perhaps identical, mtDNA, although there are several reasons why they sometimes do so (Ballard and Whitlock 2004). There are subsequent reports of muntjacs under the name '<em>M</em>. <em>crinifrons</em>' from areas of China adjacent to northern Myanmar and some way to the west (Schaller and Rabinowitz 2004, Chen <em>et al.</em> 2007) and adjacent areas of India (Datta 2003, Johnsingh 2004, Mukherjee 2013, Menon 2014). The identification in Chen <em>et al.</em> (2007) was based explicitly solely on mtDNA and <em>M</em>. <em>gongshanensis </em>may not have been considered (the name <em>M. gongshanensis </em>was associated with the name ‘Roosevelt’s Muntjak’ [sic], for which the code ‘Mgon’ was used; yet no result was given anywhere for ‘Mgon’, nor is either species discussed); Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004) took M<em>.</em> <em>gongshanensis </em>as a synonym of <em>M. crinifrons</em>. Therefore, none of these identifications can be taken as clearly indicative of M. <em>crinifrons</em>, if <em>M</em>. <em>gongshanensis </em>is considered a distinct species (as it is here; see also the <em>M</em>. <em>gongshanensis </em>Red List account). <br/><br/><em>M. gongshanensis</em> and <em>M. crinifrons</em> were maintained as distinct by Grubb (2005): the two differ substantially in morphological characters (Ma <em>et al.</em> 1990, Groves and Grubb 1990, R.J.

The original material collected in October 1997 consisted of a single trophy frontlet with antlers (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Other specimens of small muntjacs were subsequently collected in the same area by Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc, consisting of further trophy frontlets, tails and two nearly complete specimens (Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A sample of tissue (reportedly from the initial trophy) was sent to P. Arctander (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and this appears to be basis for the claim made by P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998) of a new undescribed species of muntjac in Viet Nam. However, G. Amato (pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 1998) was sent a partial sequence by P. Arctander, which he assumes was the sequence used as the basis for the latter claim of P.M. Giao <em>et al</em>. (1998). This sequence was intraspecifically comparable to that of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. If this sequence did in fact come from Le Trong Trai's material, specifically from the holotype, and bearing in mind that two species might have similar mtDNA (see Ballard and Whitlock 2004), <em>M. puhoatensis</em> may therefore be a junior subjective synonym of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. The tails do not belong to <em>M. vaginalis</em> and the trophies and two near-complete specimens correspond with the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex (which includes also <em>M. truongsonensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em>). Further morphological determination is not possible, because application of the name <em>M. puhoatensis</em>. can only be determined by reference to the holotype, which lacks morphological features for determination within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex, the other material from around the type locality cannot be assumed necessarily to come from the same species as the holotype because species within the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> complex appear to be sympatric in parts of Lao PDR and Viet Nam (see <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> Red List account). Conservative reasoning suggests taking <em>M. puhoatensis</em> as synonymous with either <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> or <em>M. truongsonensis</em> (which was described a few weeks earlier) until otherwise proven different. Because it is not possible to determine with which of those it should be aligned, it is here kept distinct. See the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> Red List account for a fuller description of taxonomic issues in this species complex. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014a) reported <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> from the Pu Hoat and Xuan Lien Nature Reserves of Vietnam on the basis of the 16s mitochondrial gene, analysed from four specimens, the paper also claimed to have confirmed the identification on the basis of other mitochondrial genes and nuclear genes, but these apparently have never been determined for the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> holotype, and furthermore the paper presents no data to support the claim that nuclear genes provide taxonomic resolution of the sampled specimens’ identities. Le <em>et al.</em> (2014 b) report nine cytochrome b sequences from samples collected in Xuan Lien NR as analogous to <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>. Neither paper lists actual details of the sources of their sequences, and the sample numbers given in each paper follow different formats, leaving it uncertain as to whether some of the samples are common to both studies. The reported locality of the Pu Hoat samples however is close to if not the same as the type locality of <em>M. puhoatensis</em>, a species undiagnosable at present because the type material is fragmentary, lacking any known diagnostic features, and has also never been genetically analysed with certainty (Minh Le Duc pers. comm. 2015, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Two relatively complete muntjac specimens from the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex from the Pu Hoat region seen by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2015) had several morphological characteristics at variance with the holotype of <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> suggesting that the identification of muntjac specimens from the Pu Hoat region should be taken with care, until identification can be corroborated by additional evidence including morphology and nuclear DNA (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Several popular media articles that reported the findings of Le <em>et al.</em> (2014) also included camera-trap photographs from Xuan Lien Nature Reserve purported to show <em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, however the muntjacs visible in these photographs were either certainly identifiable as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or unidentifiable to species as they lacked visible diagnostic characteristics."

136551,Muntiacus vaginalis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,CERVIDAE,Muntiacus,vaginalis,,,,,"(Boddaert, 1785)","Taxonomic Notes:&#160;&#160; &#160;Groves (2003) elected to raise non-Sundaic forms of <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.l.</em>) from subspecific taxa to the species <em>M. vaginalis</em>, leaving the Sundaic forms to constitute <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.s.</em>). In 2008 the IUCN Red List chose to follow this split, with the following caveats. This position, already postulated by previous authors (e.g. Groves and Grubb 1990), rests on little evidence, primarily the assumption that all taxa within M. muntjak in the Sunda region carry a unique karyotype different from all <em>M. vaginalis</em> in northern regions. However, the Sundaic karyotype seems to have been documented in only a few individuals from the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Wurster and Aitkin 1972, Groves and Grubb 1990, Groves 2003, Tanomtong <em>et al.</em> 2005), assumed to be <em>M. muntjak</em> (the type locality of the later is Java). Other purported differences (e.g. dorsal darkening and short nasals, Groves 2003, Groves and Grubb 1990), if they can be considered diagnostic characters rather than traits (see below), appear minor rather than ones likely to separate species-level taxa. Although differences in chromosome number between muntjacs appears likely to constitute a good species boundary, preventing extensive interbreeding (see Groves and Grubb 1990), a much wider sampling of karyotype (especially within the presumed range of <em>M. muntjak</em> (<em>s.s.</em>)) is needed to place on solid ground the systematic position which assumes separate and widespread ranges for the two so far identified karyotypes. There appears to have been no significant further investigation of this taxonomic split since 2008, and thus the 2014 reassessment largely for the sake of status quo maintains this taxonomic treatment.<br/><br/>Groves (2003) and other authors (e.g., P.M. Giao <em>et al.</em> 1998) have suggested that northern forms here placed within<em> M. vaginalis</em> may constitute more than one species, and Groves and Grubb (2011) separated the taxon into four species, <em>M. vaginalis s.s.</em> (central range, the most widespread of the four), M. malabaricus (extreme southwest of range), M. aureus (western range with an outlier in the central part of the range) and <em>M. nigripes</em> (eastern parts of the range). The purported differences between these taxa include body size, antler size and general and or midback, nape and crown pelage colour and or more specifically its darkness. The purported descriptions presumably meant to indicate diagnostic differences and the grounds for considering the species valid are often internally inconsistent, for example “shorter antlers” is clearly implied as a characteristic of <em>M. vaginalis</em>, <em>M. malabaricus </em>is stated to have “shorter antlers [than <em>M. vaginalis</em>]”, in<em> M. aureus </em>the “antlers short” and in <em>M. nigripes</em> once again “antlers short”. Specimens used and sample sizes are not given, nor is there in general any discussion of variation, nor reference to alternative explanations for the geographical distribution of traits. With the obvious propensity for muntjacs to undergo chromosome rearrangements, and the clear indications from certain areas of multiple sympatric and or closely parapatric muntjac species, it is clearly quite possible (perhaps even probable) that <em>M. vaginalis</em> as used here may involve multiple phylogenetic species. However the documentation of such species, especially for the sake of taxonomic stability, requires the burden of proof to be placed on those authors attempting taxonomic splits. For the reasons already outlined, small sample sizes (morphological or genetic) from disparate range locations are not adequate proof, for such a widespread, ecologically tolerant species, that effective reproductive isolation has occurred between sister lineages.<br/><br/><br/>In the context of the above it has been pointed out for instance by Groves (2003) that dark-legged Chinese and Indochinese animals (‘<em>M. nigripes</em>’ of Groves and Grubb 2011) differ from paler, more uniform, animals to the south and west (‘<em>M. vaginalis</em>’ of Groves and Grubb 2011, for further details, see also C.P. Groves in litt. 1999 to Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). However, recent data (especially the results of camera-trapping studies) from Indochina suggest that pelage colour and pattern variation is little more than a geographically based polymorphism within a widespread species, and might not warrant even use in designation of subspecific taxa (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on unpublished data from various camera-trapping projects by WWF/WCS/FFI/SFNC/IUCN). There are certainly no grounds from field studies to suggest that more than one species-level taxon is present in Indochina (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Because objective morphological grounds to allow confident separation of the two species <em>M. muntjak</em> and <em>M. vaginalis</em> are not yet validated, because published sources and opinion in the region universally treat the two as conspecific, and because surveys have not systematically been examining the chromosomes of muntjacs, for the purposes of this red list assessment, each species' range and status have been assessed taking an assumption that the Isthmus of Kra forms the boundary between the two. This follows the assessment of Groves and Grubb (1990), based on rather few specimens, which segregated animals primarily on the basis of pelage and nasal characters, these authors noted the presence of specimens from two localities just south of the Isthmus of Kra which were somewhat atypical from presumed <em>M. muntjak</em> specimens further south. Many other vertebrates have diagnosable Sunda and northern members, but the range boundary between them can occur anywhere over a relatively wide latitudinal zone (e.g. Hughes <em>et al.</em> 2003), and outlier populations of one or the other taxon can occur within the range of its sister. Most taxa with clearly different Sundaic and mainland taxa are closely associated with ‘evergreen’ or semi-evergreen closed canopy forest, which makes the phylogeography of these species relatively easy to understand, however <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em> is generally unlike these in having a very broad habitat usage which includes deciduous open canopy forest formations, as such the exposed Sunda shelf at the height of the Pleistocene presumably provided a link between <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em> on the mainland in southern Indochina with those on northern Borneo. <em>M. vaginalis</em> as used here may thus occur in the Sundas. <br/><br/>During the 2008 review, a number of sources indicated that Red Muntjac was being identified by vocalisation, even in areas where congeners were known or likely to occur. There is no available information on vocal characters of other muntjacs, and how to distinguish different muntjacs by voice, or even whether this is possible. Therefore, such identifications were taken as only indicating the genus."

To date, new specimens and camera trapping photographs from Bolivia (Yensen <em>et al.</em> 1994, Rumiz <em>et al</em>. 2007) and new specimens and photographs from Peru, provide evidence that the southern Andean form is the same as the <em>M. chunyi</em> originally described by Hershkovitz (1959).

There is no question of the validity of <em>M. atherodes</em> as a species, because it has multiple diagnostic features and is widely sympatric with Southern Red Muntjac <em>M. muntjak</em> (Groves and Grubb 1982, 1990); but identification to species, particularly on field views and typical camera-trap photographs, of the two muntjacs on Borneo is difficult, and many observers have therefore considered it sensible to present survey results only as 'muntjac sp(p)'.

Placement in the genus <em>Panolia</em> (as used by Pocock 1943) could be an acceptable alternative and was proposed by Groves and Grubb (2011) based on mtDNA analysis of Pitra <em>et al.</em> (2004). Based on the Phylogenetic Species Concept, Groves and Grubb (2011) recognized three ‘species’ of <em>Panolia</em>: <em>P. eldii</em>, <em>P. thamin</em> and <em>P. siamensis</em> supported on the basis of morphological and mtDNA analysis.

29742,Rangifer tarandus,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,CERVIDAE,Rangifer,tarandus,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","The world’s Caribou and Reindeer are classified as a single species <em>Rangifer</em> <em>tarandus</em>. Reindeer is the European name for the species while in North America, the species is known as Caribou. Here we use either name or <em>Rangifer</em>. <br/><br/>Identification of subspecies has changed over time (Banfield 1961, Geist 2007) and currently, Grubb (2005) lists 14 sub-species of which two are extinct: <em>eogroenlandicus </em>and <em>dawsoni</em>, however, the latter may have been an island dwarf form (Byun <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Russia, the use of subspecies differs from Grubb (2005) as <em>angustirostris </em>is recognized but not <em>buskensis </em>(I. Mizin pers. comm.). The subspecies are distinguished largely on skeletal and skull measurements, antler architecture and behaviour. The major groupings of subspecies are Boreal forest, continental tundra and high Arctic island. Based on current abundance, continental tundra caribou are the most numerous (56%) relative to mountain (19%), the forest (14%) and Arctic island (11%). <br/><br/>The current diversity of <em>Rangifer </em>resulted from local adaptations, which followed large-scale changes in distribution as continental glaciations advanced and retreated during the Pleistocene (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). Analyses of mitochondrial and nucleotide DNA reveal that glaciations divided <em>Rangifer </em>into two lineages. The ice sheets were more extensive in North Ameri<em>ca.</em> Thus, the Euro-Beringia lineage was restricted to Alaska while the North American lineage was restricted to south of the ice sheets. The Euro-Beringia lineage is genetically the most varied and is widely distributed from Eurasia to northwestern America also including Greenland, Svalbard and the Canadian Arctic island archipelagos (Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013). The second lineage, the North American lineage (essentially woodland caribou), has less genetic variation and a more restricted distribution limited to Newfoundland/Labrador and eastern Canada. After deglaciation about 10,000 years ago, changing distribution during recolonization, secondary contact between the two lineages occurred in central and western Canada (Weckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Yannic <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Genetic variability is typically high among the larger migratory herds of migratory tundra Caribou (Zittlau 2004) because the effective population size is large and geographic barriers are largely lacking. Elsewhere in the mountains, genetic variation reveals a complex history influenced by events including ancient volcanic eruptions, founder events, geography and changing abundance and distribution of neighbouring herds (Kuhn <em>et al.</em> 2010, Serrouya <em>et al.</em> 2012). On the arctic islands, genetic variation is reduced because those populations have been through severe reductions in abundance with consequent genetic bottlenecks and genetic drift (Zittlau 2004, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Dispersal whether innate or environmental is largely unrecorded in <em>Rangifer </em>except at the scale of genetic migration. DNA analyses have revealed low rates of male-biased genetic flow between neighbouring and geographically dispersed <em>Rangifer </em>(Boulet <em>et al.</em> 2005, Roffler <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>The subspecies designations are based on an outdated taxonomy and are inconsistent with current understanding of evolutionary relationships and ecology (Flagstad and Røed 2003, Zittlau 2005, Røed 2005). However, in the context of conservation and management, recognizable and credible ‘conservation units’ or ‘evolutionary significant units’ are essential. In Canada, for example, COSEWIC (2012) assessed all available information to create 12 designatable units to recognize variability in form, ecology and genetics previously combined in four sub-species. We will refer to recognizable conservation units throughout this assessment as these are the basis for estimating abundance. Then we have summed the subspecies or conservation units to assess <em>Rangifer</em> at the species level."

Groves pers. comm. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It was treated as a distinct species by Miller (1942) on the basis of a single specimen available to him that clearly was not conspecific with <em>Muntiacus muntjak muntjak</em>, which also inhabits Sumatra. He was not able to examine Robinson and Kloss’s specimens and so retained a margin of doubt that his skull was conspecific with the latter. There remain very few validated records of the taxon, which externally is not greatly different from <em>M. muntjak,</em> which together continues to cloud its treatment as a valid species.<br/><br/>As with muntjacs in Borneo (Groves and Grubb 1982), there has doubtless been some confusion and misidentification of Sumatran specimens in past literature. Reviewers including Miller (1942), Van Bemmel (1952), and Groves and Grubb (1990) certainly or apparently had no access to the specimens used to describe the taxon. This may well have led to erroneous views on the taxon’s diagnostic features. The holotype is in the Natural History Museum, London (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), rather than lost, contrary to Van Bemmel (1952). The degree of misidentification of specimens, if any, can be determined only through thorough re-evaluation of Sumatran muntjac specimens, including those used by previous authors. Further confusion has arisen through suggestions that <em>M. montanus</em> is the Sumatran ‘equivalent’ of Bornean <em>M. atherodes</em>, the two having features in common (formerly mistakenly called <em>M. pleiharicus</em>, which name is now recognised to be the valid name for the race of <em>M. muntjak</em> on Borneo), although the two species show very little similarity in characters that are likely to be taxonomically informative (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There has also been a pre-eminence awarded by authors such as Van Bemmel (1952) to use of general body pelage, body size and antler size for distinction between the two Sumatran muntjac species, characters which are unlikely to be diagnostic in any way (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). These appear to be the primary characters used by Van Bemmel (1952) when concluding that a specimen from “Tebing Tinggi, lowlands of Deli, East Sumatra … is more or less intermediate between [<em>M. m. muntjak</em> and <em>M. montanus</em>]…” and “proof that <em>M. m. montanus</em> cannot be regarded as a good species”. Van Bemmel (1952) mentions nothing of the large size of the preorbital fossa, identified by Miller (1942), or specific details about the crown pelage of females, both likely to be main diagnostic characteristics of the species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, neither character were mentioned by Groves and Grubb 1990)."

(1993) who demonstrated that these animals were more closely related to the (Sundaic) <em>S. barbatus</em>. Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Analysis of skull measurements clustered <em>S. celebensis</em> with <em>S. philippensis</em> and <em>S. cebifrons</em> from the Philippines (Lucchini <em>et al</em>. 2005). From this study and that of Groves (1997) it was proposed that these species are primitive forms and have a relict distribution. <em>Sus celebensis</em> is thought to have separated from an ancestral species that inhabited Sunderland. Analysis of mtDNA found that <em>S. celebensis</em> had a greater maternal affinity to Bornean pigs than those from New Guinea (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2005), however, pigs from the Philippines were not included in the genetic study to allow comparison. Phylogenomic analysis implies that populations on Borneo acted as the initial and main source for the dispersal to Sulawesi. At a later stage <em>S. verrucosus</em> on Java and <em>S. cebifrons</em> in the Philippines are thought to have contributed to the <em>S. celebensis</em> gene pool (Frantz <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The Sulawesi Warty Pig, like the other Asian <em>Sus</em> spp., has a chromosome number of 38 (Bosma <em>et al</em>. 1991). However, there are significant differences in the banding of its Y chromosome when compared with either <em>S. scrofa</em> or <em>S. verrucosus</em>.<br/><br/>A recent genetic study found that Sulawesi Warty Pigs are not monophyletic, instead they form two clades (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2005). mtDNA sequences showed that these clades are distributed in a north-south pattern and contain high genetic diversity. This may lend support to the proposed cline in body size on Sulawesi from north (smallest) to south (largest) (Groves <em>et al</em>. 1993). The current classification of a monotypic species by Groves (1981) may warrant further genetic investigation. The two clades can be explained either by the occurrence of two colonization events onto Sulawesi (Frantz <em>et al</em>. 2013), or the historic fragmentation of the island into at least two parts. Independent invasions by other species have been reported, including macaques (Evans <em>et al</em>. 1999) and shrews (Ruedi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Fragmentation of Sulawesi has been shown to have occurred from pollen records in at least two locations during the Late Pleistocene period (Fooden 1969)."

(In addition, Hubback (1937) thought that there may be two subspecies of Gaur in Malaysia, one with a well developed dewlap and one without.) However, this trifid arrangement, based largely on differences in colouration and size, is no longer widely recognized (Grzimek 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992).<br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb (cited in National Research Council 1983) concluded that there were only two subspecies: <em>Bos gaurus gaurus</em> in India and Nepal; and <em>Bos gaurus laosiensis</em> in Myanmar (Burma), Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, and West Malaysia (and presumably southern China). More recent work by Groves and colleagues (e.g., Groves 2003) also supports this division into two subspecies. Analysis of skull and horn measurements revealed little multivariate overlap between Indian and Southeast Asian specimens: Southeast Asian specimens are much bigger, with relatively shorter nasal bones, a less wide horn span and a narrower occiput; and in South-east Asian specimens the ascending branch of the premaxilla generally does not reach the nasal, whereas in Indian specimens it usually does. Specimens from Bhutan, Chittagong (Bangladesh), Upper Chindwin (north Myanmar), and Mogok (north Myanmar) were intermediate, but tended more towards the South-east Asian type. The locations of these specimens suggest that the Gaur in north-east India are also likely to be intermediate but more similar to southeast Asian animals than to the Gaur in the rest of India (C. Groves pers. comm. 1995). In recognition of these phenotypic differences, <em>B. g. gaurus</em> and <em>B. g. laosiensis</em> are provisionally accepted here pending further morphometric and genetic study.<br/> <br/>The extinct subspecies <em>B. g. sinhaleyus</em> survived on Sri Lanka into historic times (Grubb 2005)."

The East and Southern African group is comprised of a single subspecies (<em>Syncerus caffer caffer</em>), which is found in the assessment region.

Forest Buffalo are adapted to forest life, having a smaller size, unobtrusive swept back horns and a red to reddish-brown colouration, and are restricted to West Africa (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Southern Savannah Buffalo are about twice the size of Forest Buffalo, with large downward curved horns and a brownish to black colouration (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The taxonomic uncertainty in these four subspecies is corroborated by the observation of interbreeding and intermediate phenotypes in contact zones between all four subspecies (Prins 1996), and at least one reported cross between <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>.<em> caffer</em> and <em>S</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>nanus</em> (Smitz <em><em>et al.</em> </em>2013).

This putative species also occurs in rivers in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando Departments of the Bolivian Amazon basin and in the Madeira River of Brazil. It does not overlap with other <em>Inia</em> populations in several morphological characters including rostral length, and it has significant differences in the number of teeth (da Silva 1994). The <em>boliviensis</em> form is considered to have been reproductively isolated by a long series of rapids for an estimated 3.1 million years (Hollatz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear introns have been interpreted as suggesting that these dolphins are on a separate evolutionary trajectory and therefore may deserve recognition as a phylogenetic species (Banguera-Hinestroza <em>et al.</em> 2002, Ruiz-García <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, Gravena <em>et al.</em> (2014a,b), with better sampling of the Madeira River system above and below the Teotônio Rapids (the proposed barrier to movement of individuals and gene flow), found that these rapids did not appear to obstruct gene flow from the upstream to the downstream population. Gravena <em>et al.</em> (2015) nevertheless concluded that <em>Inia</em> along the Madeira River possess the unique mtDNA of the putative species <em>I. boliviensis</em> (one line of evidence for recognizing species-level difference), and they argued that even if there is hybridization in the contact zone in the Madeira River, <em>Inia</em> below Teotônio remain distinct and follow an independent evolutionary path. </p><p>    </p><p>The nominal species <em>Inia araguaiaensis</em> was described from the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin (Hrbek <em>et al</em>. 2014), which is not connected to the Amazon River basin.

These dolphins are also known from the Guamá River. The Committee on Taxonomy (2017) reasoned that because Hrbek <em>et al.</em> (2014) only examined samples from two extremes of the distribution of&#160;<em>Inia</em> it was unclear if the molecular differences observed represented real species-level separation. In addition, the Committee concluded that diagnostic osteological differences were based on the examination of very few specimens (only two for the nominal species and nine for&#160;<em>I. geoffrensis)&#160;</em>and did not account for effects of the significant sexual dimorphism. A few more specimens were examined by Siciliano <em>et al.</em> (2016b) confirming the findings of Hrbek <em>et al</em>.

However, this assertion of species status rests on very little evidence, primarily the assumption that all <em>M. muntjac</em> in the Sunda region carry a unique karyotype different from all <em>M. vaginalis</em> in northern regions. However, the Sundaic karyotype has only been documented in a single individual from the Malay Peninsula south of the Ismuth of Kra. Other purported differences (e.g. dorsal darkening, Groves (2003)), if they can be considered characters rather than traits, appear minor and certainly not ones which would separate species level taxa. A much wider sampling of karyotype is needed for this systematic position to be placed on solid ground. <br/> <br/>Groves and Grubb 1990 considered the Sundaic <em>M. muntjak</em> populations to represent a single subspecies, while considering northern mainland populations (here considered as <em>M. vaginalis</em>) to be composed of many. However, many subspecies have been described from the Sunda region, and the geographical variation present is certainly equivalent to that present in (in <em>M. vaginalis</em>) northern regions. Javan and Malay Peninsula populations represent large red forms, Bornean and probably also Sumatran animals appear somewhat smaller and darker, while some offshore island populations (i.e. Bali) are probably significantly smaller. <br/> <br/>In this account, <em>Muntiacus muntjak</em> is considered to be exclusively restricted to peninsular Thailand south of the Isthmus of Kra, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, Lombok and other small islands of the region (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Groves 2003). The possible existence of hybrid populations (<em>M. vaginalis</em> x <em>M. muntjak</em>), in northern continental Malaysia, has also been recently pointed out by Groves (2005). <br/> <br/>Adding to the systematic confusion throughout the genus, the Red Muntjac is sometimes classified as <em>M. vaginalis</em>, including up to five subspecies including <em>nigripes</em> (Wang 2002)."

However, Meijaard and Groves (2004) actually dated <I>Cervus javanicus</i> Osbeck to 1757, not to 1765. The situation is complicated and Meijaard and Groves (2004) indicated that they would be making a submission to the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature. Pending the result of this, the name for this species follows usage by Grubb (2005).
<br>
<br>Whoever the name is credited to, the lack of any biological type material has led to its application within the genus <i>Tragulus</i> having a contorted history, elaborated in Meijaard and Groves (2004). In sum, usage in past publications of <i>T. javanicus</i> can rarely if ever be taken at face value to represent the species as circumscribed here, unless explicit mention is made that the statements refer to the animals of Java. Up to and including Chasen (1940), the name <i>T. javanicus</i> was used for the larger chevrotains, with <i>Moschus kanchil</i> Raffles, 1821 for the smaller ones (dated as 1822 by Meijaard and Groves 2004). Van Bemmel (1949), building on Chasen’s (1940: 194) comment that “I rather doubt if <i>javanicus</i> [i.e. the larger chevrotains] occurs there [ = anywhere on Java]”, proposed that <i>T. javanicus</i> should be used for the smaller chevrotains, with <i>Moschus napu</i> F. Cuvier, 1822 being the first available name for a larger chevrotain. This system almost universally was followed up to Meijaard and Groves (2004) who proposed that the smaller chevrotains contained several species, and that the form on Java was specifically distinct and endemic to the island. This form being <i>T. javanicus</i>, nearly all the off-Java forms fell under <i>T. kanchil</i>, as they previously had done under Chasen (1940). <i>Tragulus kanchil williamsoni</i> Kloss, 1916, placed within <i>T. javanicus</i> from Van Bemmel (1949) onwards, was segregated as a monotypic species by Meijaard and Groves (2004). 
<br>
<br>Further change within the taxonomy and nomenclature of the genus is likely, given the ominous statement in Meijaard and Groves (2004) that ""because many type specimens, especially of small island taxa are located in the Smithsonian Museum, which we did not visit, we were unable to assess the validity of all taxa. We intend to address the variation between these island taxa...in future publications"". Whatever the findings of these examinations, they are unlikely to affect usage of the name <i>T. javanicus</i> for a chevrotain on Java. A separate issue is whether there is truly only one species on the island. Meijaard and Groves (2004) reviewed past claims of two subspecies of smaller chevrotain and concluded that ""our craniometrical data indicate that there may indeed be two distinct mouse-deer taxa on Java. The data are, however, inconclusive...further research...is required"". These two taxa would both belong in the smaller chevrotains (the <i>T. javanicus</i> group). A yet further unresolved issue concerning the genus on Java is that three chevrotain specimens objectively and clearly identifiable as large chevrotains (<i>T. napu</i> group) were reported by the collector, E. Dubois, to be from Java; two have the precise and traceable locality of Mount Willis (Meijaard and Groves 2004). The latter suggested that ""it may be that Dubois collected these specimens during his earlier fieldwork in Sumatra, after which they were mislabelled"", a speculation for which there seems to be no foundation other than the lack of other specimens of <i>T. napu</i> from Java.
<br>
<br>In this preliminary assessment, the provisional course of assuming that all records of chevrotains from Java relate to <i>T. javanicus</i> is taken with reservations. Field identification of <i>Tragulus</i> is difficult, even under the pre-2004 conventional arrangement of two species widely sympatric. If there is only one species on Java, all records of the genus can safely be assumed to relate to that species; but if there are two or even three, assignment to <i>T. javanicus</i> without critical evaluation is not possible."

Because it is known only from one specimen, it is difficult to determine the taxonomic significance of its large size (compared with <em>T. kanchil</em> and <em>T. javanicus</em>). This is compounded by the lack of available specimens of chevrotains from close to the type locality of <em>T. williamsoni</em> (in the northern highlands of Thailand) to test for conspecificity with <em>T. kanchil</em> and, if the taxon is validated, to determine the nature of the boundary with <em>T. kanchil</em> (sympatry or parapatry).

Although Meijaard and Groves (2004) considered <em>T. williamsoni</em> to be “very large”, this is under conditions of museum measurement (“larger than the means of all other mouse-deer from the Asian mainland...for most of the individual measurements it was also larger than the maximum values for the ....mainland Asia <em>T. kanchil</em> subspecies”. No difference is likely to be apparent if measurements are not taken, so records hitherto assigned to <em>T. kanchil</em> (mostly under the name <em>T. javanicus</em>) from areas of northern Southeast Asia and China which have not been validated by specimens must now be regarded as indeterminate. Even measurements need careful interpretation: Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) measured skulls from southern Viet Nam (far from the holotype of <em>T. williamsoni</em>) of what they assigned to <em>T. kanchil</em> and found sizes exceeding those documented for Indochinese <em>T. kanchil</em> by Meijaard and Groves (2004) and even approaching those of <em>T. williamsoni</em>. They underlined how differences between individual people in style of skull measurement can be as significant as actual differences size in terms of apparent size results when measuring skulls of similar species. If <em>T. williamsoni</em> is a valid taxon, confirming additional specimens as such will clearly require great care."

This segregation is founded upon a Phylogenetic Species Concept. Many sources up to 2005 referred to Indian animals as part of <em>M. meminna</em> (seen as the only species in the genus). Prior to Groves and Grubb (1987), the taxa within <em>Moschiola</em> were commonly referred to as <em>Tragulus meminna</em>.

Previous to this, all populations within <em>Moschiola</em> were considered conspecific, under the name <em>M. meminna</em> (as the oldest in the genus) and, prior to Groves and Grubb (1987), often as <em>Tragulus meminna</em>. The reality of the Groves and Meijaard (2005) taxonomic hypothesis, of two distinct species of Chevrotain on Sri Lanka, one each in the dry and wet zones (and perhaps a third in the hill zone), and another in India, would benefit from independent confirmation: only three wet-zone skulls were available for the key analysis, making the significance of their absolute separation from the dry-zone series difficult to assess. However, as skull differences co-vary with pelage and body proportions, their taxonomic proposals are followed here, in the hope that so doing will encourage the generation of further information to consolidate or modify the arrangement. The hill zone animals are not considered under this species."

In the absence of genetic information, the subpopulation was initially assumed to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tursiops truncatus</span> (Williams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1993, Schneider 1999, Haase 2000). However, the emergence of taxonomic debates regarding Bottlenose Dolphin classification globally (LeDuc <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999), led some to conclude that classifying the subpopulation as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. truncatus</span> may be premature and hence the classification <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tursiops</span> sp. or spp. was employed (Lusseau <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003, Lusseau and Wing 2006, Currey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Currey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008b). A further reason for this approach was that the Fiordland bottlenose dolphins exhibit unusual morphological and sociological characteristics – large, rotund body shapes and long-term close associations – traits that have been attributed to geographic isolation (Schneider 1999, Lusseau <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003) that may have reflected underlying taxonomic differences.</p>  <p>Recently, a genetic study comparing New Zealand Bottlenose Dolphins to samples taken worldwide has concluded the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphins should be classified as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. truncatus</span> (Tezanos-Pinto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Further, this study revealed coastal subpopulations within New Zealand show a high degree of isolation from each other (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.171, Φ<sub>ST</sub> = 0.206, P &lt; 0.001; Tezanos-Pinto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Pair-wise comparison revealed the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphins were isolated from both other Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulations in New   Zealand: Northland (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.150, P &lt; 0.001, Φ<sub>ST</sub> = 0.197, P &lt; 0.05) and the Marlborough Sounds (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.239, P &lt; 0.001, Φ<sub>ST</sub> = 0.298, P &lt; 0.05; Tezanos-Pinto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Estimates of female migration rates per generation reflected this isolation, with low levels of exchange between Fiordland and Northland (4.89 female migrants per generation 95% CI: 0.02–20.32; 0.19 female emigrants per generation 95% CI: 0.00–1.70) and between Fiordland and the Marlborough Sounds (0.31 female migrants per generation 95% CI: 0.00–3.12; 0.29 female emigrants per generation 95% CI: 0.00–2.01; Tezanos-Pinto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). This isolation ensures the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphins qualify as a discrete subpopulation; hence the criteria for a population are applied.</p>"

Five species of <em>Mustelus</em> are known to frequent the waters surrounding Baja California. One of these five species, <em>M. albipinnis</em>, was only recently described and has likely been misidentified in the past as other Mustelus spp. (Castro-Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Mustelus albipinnis</em> is distinguished from <em>M. californicus</em> by white margins present on its fins and a habitat preference for deeper waters (Castro-Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Another Baja California smooth-hound, <em>M. lunulatus</em> is considered to be the most similar to <em>M. californicus</em> due to similar colour patterns (grey dorsal colouration with a lighter ventral side). <em>Mustelus lunulatus</em> can be distinguished from <em>M. californicus</em> by its wider set eyes, longer snout and shorter upper labial furrows (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Both species, however, have well developed lower caudals and molariform teeth (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Dentition can be used to distinguish <em>M. californicus</em> from both <em>M. dorsalis</em> and <em>M. henlei</em> which both have sharper high-cusped teeth (Starks 1917, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). <em>Mustelus henlei</em> can also be differentiated by the dorsal fins, which are frayed at the posterior margins and more anteriorly placed along the body than <em>M. californicus</em> (Starks 1917, Ebert 2003, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013)."

They gave no sample sizes or information on animals in the area where the two forms abut, making it difficult to assess the validity of the proposal. This warrants priority investigation because the distributions of the two species mean that the western form is relatively secure, with large subpopulations in many well-managed protected areas, whereas the eastern form has very few apparently secure subpopulations and would, if assessed separately, warrant a Red List Category at least one level more threatened than that for the western form.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Throughout at least Indochina there is a predictable flow of reports of ‘novel’ variation in large deer, with the implication that a new species may be involved (e.g. Pham Trong Anh <em>et al.</em> 1996 and, particularly, surveys through local people by overseas consultants); these stem from Sambar (often young animals) with unbranched antlers."

This became something of a mystery taxon and is different from the gazelles currently found there. Bärman <em>et al. </em>(2012) extracted DNA from the type specimen and showed that this was not a single specimen, assigning the skin to <em>G. g. cora </em>and the skull to gazelles of the northern type (<em>G. g. gazella</em>).<br/><br/>Wronski<em> et al.</em> (2010) showed that <em>Gazella gazella</em>, in fact, consists of two monophyletic lineages, a northern clade (represented by samples from the Golan Heights) and a southern clade (based on samples from the Arabian Peninsula including the southern Arava Valley), based on mtDNA markers. Lerp <em>et al.</em> (2012) produced similar conclusions using nuclear markers and including samples from Central Israel. A morphological and genetic study of genus <em>Gazella </em>(Bärmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), and a genetic study of gazelles in the southern Levant (Hadas<em> et al. </em>2015) all further support the existence of two monophyletic lineages: a northern clade (<em>Gazella gazella</em>), and a southern clade (provisionally named<em> G. arabica</em> on the basis that this name takes precedence over <em>cora</em>).<br/><br/>This arrangement is now followed by the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group, with<em> G. gazella </em>replacing <em>G. g. gazella </em>in the former arrangement, and the name <em>G. arabica</em> provisionally retained for the southern clade, pending a ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). So <em>G. arabica</em>, as understood here, comprises all the gazelles formerly considered under<em> G. gazella</em>, from the southern Negev through the Arabian Peninsula.<br/><br/>Several subspecies have been named under <em>G. gazella</em> and have previously been evaluated for The IUCN Red List: <em>acaciae</em>; in the southern Arava Valley; <em>cora </em>in most of the Arabian Peninsula; <em>farasani </em>on the Farasan Islands; and&#160;<em>muscatensis </em>on the Batinah coast of Oman. Genetic research by scientists at King Khaled Wildlife Research Centre (Saudi Arabia) and Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has confirmed the existence of some intraspecific variation, but there is no agreement on the validity of these named subspecies and they are not assessed separately for the time being, until a definitive analysis has been produced.

In a critical contribution, Stuenes (1989) thoroughly described the morphological differences between these species and provided detailed diagnoses. After Stuenes’ work (1989), the most complete account is that by Rakotovao <em>et al.</em> (2014), who notably documented significant intraspecific variations within both species. The origin of these species remains uncertain: they are generally seen as deriving from continental species of <em>Hippopotamus</em>, maybe from the extant <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>. A third extinct Madagascan species, <em>Hippopotamus laloumena</em>, was proposed by Faure and Guérin (1990) on limited evidence. A recent publication by Faure <em>et al.</em> (2010) does not add significant evidence in favor of the validity of this species, and&#160; its dissimilarity from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em> needs to be clarified. It may represent evidence for sporadic Mozambique Channel crossing by individuals of the extant large species during the Holocene, including since the European colonization of Madagascar (Burney <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Fovet <em>et al</em>. (2011) suggested that Guldberg's type specimen of <em>H. madagscariensis</em> actually pertains to the other small species, <em>H. lemerlei</em>. In 1902, C.J.F. Major re-described <em>H. madagascariensis</em> Gulberg, 1883 using a new Malagasy skeleton which was quite different to <em>H. lemerlei</em>. However, because <em>H. madagascariensis</em> would be no more than a replacement name for <em>H. lemerlei</em>, Fovet <em>et al</em>. (2011) proposed the new name <em>H. guldbergi</em> to designate the species described in 1902 by C.J.F. Major. Rakotovao <em>et al.</em> (2014) disagreed with Fauvet <em>et al. </em>(2011) on the attribution of Guldberg’s specimen to <em>H. lemerlei</em>, and confirmed its identification as <em>H. madagascariensis</em>, in line with Stuenes (1989).

In a critical contribution, Stuenes (1989) thoroughly described the morphological differences between these species and provided detailed diagnoses. After Stuenes' work (1989), the most complete account is that by Rakotovao <em>et al.</em> (2014), who notably documented significant intraspecific variations within both species. The origin of these species remains uncertain: they are generally seen as deriving from continental species of <em>Hippopotamus</em>, maybe from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>. A third extinct Madagascan species, <em>Hippopotamus laloumena</em>, was proposed by Faure and Guérin (1990) on limited evidence. A recent publication by Faure<em> et al.</em> (2010) does not add significant evidence in favor of the validity of this species, and its dissimilarity from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em> still needs to be clarified (Weston and Lister 2009). It may represent evidence for sporadic Mozambique Channel crossing by individuals of the extant large species during the Holocene, including since the European colonization of Madagascar (Burney <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Fovet <em>et al</em>. (2011) suggested that Guldberg's type specimen of <em>H. madagscariensis</em> actually pertains to the other small species, <em>H. lemmerlei</em>. In 1902, C.J.F. Major re-described <em>H. madagascariensis</em> Gulberg, 1883 using a new Malagasy skeleton which was quite different to <em>H. lemmerlei</em>. However, because <em>H. madagscariensis</em> would be no more than a replacement name for <em>H. lemerlei</em>, Fovet <em>et al. </em>(2011) proposed the new name <em>H. guldbergi</em> to designate the species described in 1902 by C.J.F. Major. Rakotovao <em>et al</em>. (2014) disagreed with Fauvet <em>et al.</em> (2011) on the attribution of Guldberg’s specimen to <em>H. lemerlei</em>, and confirmed its identification as<em> H. madagascariensis,</em> in line with Stuenes (1989). This debate is not closed (see Faure <em>et al</em>. 2015), but given that <em>H. madagascariensis </em>was extensively used as an available name prior to 1961 and since then (see section 11.6 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), and given that the ICZN recommendations regarding the stability of taxonomic nomenclature, it is for now more cautious to continue to use <em>H. madagascariensis </em>and to consider <em>H. gulbergi</em> as its junior synonym.

The existence of spotted specimens outside the Mediterranean Sea, including from California (Seigel and Compagno 1986), is supported by <em>in-situ</em> observations made off Lebanon, New Zealand and Malpelo Island (Columbia), where specimens exhibit considerable variability in the presence, density and size of spots. There may be some regionalised trends controlling the intensity of such pigmentation. In the absence of any further evidence to support the validity of an <em>O. ferox</em>/<em>O. herbsti</em> dichotomy, recognition of the single <em>Odontaspis ferox</em> of Risso, as previously argued by Compagno (1984, 2001), remains valid."

Several genetic studies have recently tried to clarify the taxonomy of this species complex, but their results are not always concordant. Although Grubb (in Wilson and Reeder 2005) included <em>canadensis </em>in <em>C. elaphus</em>, sharing this conclusion with most taxonomists of 20th century, all original scientific papers published since 1995 have concluded that <em>C. elaphus</em> and <em>C. canadensis</em> are two valid species regardless of whether this conclusion was based on comparison of molecular (Kuwuyama and Ozawa 1999, Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Zhang and Zhang 2012, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015), or ethological data (Cap <em>et al.</em> 2008, Frey and Riede 2013, Pereladova 2013). Based on morphological data this was suggested earlier by several authors, e.g. Lydekker (1898), Flerov (1952) and Geist (1998) and both recent reviews on deer taxonomy are in line with this opinion (Groves and Grubb 2011, Mattioli 2011).<br/><br/>Recent analyses of the <em>Cervus </em>group (Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015, Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015, Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2016) have provided the first indications of another, fourth, species (including <em>Cervus nippon</em> sensu lato). Mitochondrial complete cytochrome b and control region sequences were analysed under a Bayesian coalescent framework to derive phylogeny, with particular attention to populations from Central Asia. The resultant phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that, after excision of <em>C. canadensis</em>, red deer are differentiated into two robust monophyletic clades corresponding to the western and eastern part of the range. At the species level, molecular data suggested this fourth species should be recognised as the Tarim Red Deer from Central Asia, including the populations from the Yarkand-Tarim and Bukhara regions and Indian Kashmir, which were formerly considered as subspecies of <em>C. elaphus</em> (<em>C. e yarkandensis</em>, <em>C. e. bactrianu</em>s and <em>C. e. hanglu</em>, respectively).<br/><br/>Lorenzini and Garofolo (2015) suggest this taxon should be recognised as the Tarim Red Deer <em>Cervus hanglu</em> Wagner, 1844, as the name with priority over <em>C. yarkandensis</em> or <em>C. </em>bactrianus. This group forms a part of the western clade and appears to have diverged from <em>C. elaphus </em>during the middle Pleistocene, at a similar time as <em>C. nippon </em>diverged from <em>C. canadensis</em>. The genetic distinctiveness of the Tarim Red Deer group is supported by previous mitochondrial studies (Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015). Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of the Tarim Red Deer to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). <em>Cervus hanglu </em>was elevated to species level for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016.

Garrick recognised <em>S. acanthias</em> and <em>S. blainville</em> from New Zealand, and <em>S. acanthias</em>, <em>S. blainville</em> and <em>S. megalops</em> from Australia. <em>Squalus blainville</em> was thought to be widespread in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans (Bigelow and Schroeder 1948, 1957; Garrick 1960). Chen <em>et al</em>. (1979) subsequently defined <em>S. blainville</em> from Japan as a species with high dorsal fins and long dorsal-fin spines.

Compagno (1984) also noted that dogfishes resembling <em>S. mitsukurii</em> occurred off Australia and New Zealand, and did not recognise <em>S. blainville</em> from the Southern Hemisphere.

Several genetic studies have recently tried to clarify the taxonomy of this species complex, but their results are not always concordant.<br/><br/>Although Grubb (in Wilson and Reeder 2005) included <em>canadensis</em> in <em>C. elaphus</em>, sharing this conclusion with most taxonomists of 20th century, all original scientific papers published since 1995 have concluded that<em> C. elaphus</em> and <em>C. canadensis</em> are two valid species regardless of whether this conclusion was based on comparison of molecular (Kuwuyama and Ozawa 1999, Randi <em>et al.</em> 2001, Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Zhang and Zhang 2012, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015), or ethological data (Cap <em>et al.</em> 2008, Frey and Riede 2013, Pereladova 2013). Based on morphological data this was suggested earlier by several authors, e.g. Lydekker (1898), Flerov (1952) and Geist (1998) and both recent reviews on cervid taxonomy are in line with this opinion (Groves and Grubb 2011, Mattioli 2011).<br/><br/>Recent analysis of the <em>Cervus </em>group (Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kumar <em>et al. </em>2016) have provided the first indications of another, fourth species (including <em>Cervus nippon</em> sensu latu). Mitochondrial complete cytochrome b and control region sequences were analysed under a Bayesian coalescent framework to derive phylogeny, with particular attention on populations from Central Asia. The resultant phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that, after excision of <em>C. canadensis</em>, red deer are differentiated&#160; into two robust monophyletic clades corresponding to the western and eastern part of the range. At the species level, molecular data suggested this fourth species should be recognized as the Tarim Red Deer from Central Asia, including the populations from the Yarkand-Tarim and Bukhara regions and Indian Kashmir, which were formerly considered as subspecies of <em>C. elaphus</em> (<em>C. e yarkandensis</em>, <em>C .e. bactrianus</em> and <em>C. e. hanglu</em>, respectively). <br/><br/>Lorenzini and Garofolo (2015) suggest this taxon should be recognized as the Tarim Red Deer <em>Cervus hanglu</em> Wagner, 1844, as the name with priority over <em>C. yarkandensis</em> or <em>C. bactrianus</em>. This group forms a part of the western clade and appears to have diverged from <em>C. elaphus</em> during the middle Pleistocene, at a similar time as <em>C. nippon</em> diverged from <em>C. canadensis</em>. The genetic distinctiveness of the Tarim Red Deer group is supported by previous mitochondrial studies (Ludt <em>et al.</em> 2004, Pitra <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015). Further investigations need to be conducted from additional molecular sources and nuclear coding genes as well as verification of morphology from museum specimens, before the elevation of the Tarim Red Deer to species level can be confirmed (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015). <em>Cervus hanglu </em>was elevated to species level for the purpose of the IUCN Red List assessment in 2016. However, it should be noted that future clarification on genetic relatedness, especially studies with nuclear markers and a more formal morphological description, may lead to further revisions to the taxonomuy of this provisional species, as more information becomes available.<br/><br/><em>C. h. bactrianus</em> and <em>C. h. yarkandensis</em> were not supported as distinct subspecies by molecular data (Lorenzini and Garofolo 2015). However, we refer to them throughout this account for ease of recognition<br/><em>C. h. hanglu</em> Wagner 1844 (N India (Kashmir))<br/><em>C. h. bactrianus</em> (W Turkestan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and N Afghanistan)<br/><em>C. h. yarkandensis</em> (E Turkestan (S Xinjiang, China))"

The German zoologist Willy Kükenthal examined it at Jena and described it as the new species <em>Sotalia teuszii</em> in honour of its discoverer (Kükenthal 1891, Kükenthal 1892, Van Beneden 1892, Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species was originally placed in the genus <em>Sotalia</em>; the genus name <em>Sousa</em> came into general use only in the 1960s (Fraser and Purves 1960, Fraser 1966). Thorough reviews of the species taxonomy are provided by Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Jefferson and Rosenbaum (2014). Photographs of the holotype are provided by Kükenthal (Table 21, Kükenthal 1892), Pilleri and Gihr (1972) and Jefferson and Van Waerebeek (2004). Illustrations of the holotype were provided by Van Beneden (1892). The holotype is now held by the British Museum (catalogue number 1893.8.1.1).<br/><br/>The collection details for the holotype are unclear but were of consequence. The dolphin skull and a shark-mauled carcass of a West African manatee were apparently recovered by Tëusz following a heavy rain storm and were subsequently confused (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). The stomach of the manatee contained vegetable matter, leading Kükenthal to hypothesize that the species was perhaps riparian and vegetarian, an impression reinforced by the dolphin’s rounded (worn) teeth. The Belgian zoologist Pierre Joseph Van Beneden (with whom Kükenthal corresponded) compounded the misunderstanding in a separate publication (Kükenthal 1891, Kükenthal 1892, Van Beneden 1892, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). Necropsies of fresh animals in the 1950s confirmed that they were piscivorous and marine (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957).<br/><br/>Recent genetic and morphometric work has served to clarify the taxonomy of the genus <em>Sousa</em> (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004, Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). The available data indicate that there is “strong and significant genetic and morphologic differentiation between <em>S. teuszii</em> and all other sampling units…with no evidence of exchange or contact” (Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). Principal components analysis demonstrated that <em>S. teuszii</em> have significantly shorter rostra, wider skulls and lower tooth counts (an average of about 30 teeth per row vs. about 33-37 for other species) when compared with Southeast African, Arabian/Persian Gulf and Indian <em>Sousa</em> specimens (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004). There are no shared mtDNA haplotypes with other species in the genus, but a phylogenetic assessment of combined nuclear and mtDNA datasets indicates that <em>S. teuszii </em>is most closely related to Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>) from South East Africa (Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013). The most plausible mechanism for their isolation is the Benguela upwelling system, an area dominated by cold upwelling that is located within the ~2,000 km distribution gap between <em>S. teuszii</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004, Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2013)."

In 2005, a study on the external and skull morphology, colour pattern, and mitochondrial DNA control region using samples from much of the genus’s range, showed that the <em>Orcaella</em> in Australia differ from those elsewhere and they are now regarded as a separate species, the Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2005). No subspecies are recognised.<br/><br/>Recent genetic analyses including samples from Papua New Guinea, and new samples from northern Australia (including the type specimen of <em>O. heinsohni</em>), confirmed the occurrence of the Australian Snubfin Dolphin in at least southern Papua New Guinea (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017)."
82031425,Sousa chinensis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,DELPHINIDAE,Sousa,chinensis,,,,,"(Osbeck, 1765)","Until recently, all Indian and Pacific Ocean humpback dolphins were considered to be part of a single widespread and highly-variable species, <em>S. chinensis</em>, whose range extended throughout the coastal rim of the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific, from South Africa in the west to northern Australia and central China in the east (see for example, Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001). &#160;However, there has long been a suspicion that the form with a distinctive dorsal hump and restricted to the Indian Ocean may be a distinct species – <em>S. plumbea</em> (see Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004). &#160;In the last few years, mitochondrial (mt) DNA analyses also suggested that humpback dolphins from Australia (previously also included in the <em>chinensis</em> species) were highly distinct from other Indo-Pacific populations, possibly at the species level (Frere <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011).<br/><br/>A global study of variation in the genus <em>Sousa</em>, combining data on skull morphology with both mtDNA and nuclear DNA data obtained throughout its range, confirmed that both <em>S. plumbea</em> and the Australian form were in fact distinct species (Mendez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). A follow-up paper by Jefferson and Rosenbaum (2014) reviewed all the available taxonomic evidence and nomenclature, and proposed a formal revision of the genus’ taxonomy. In this scheme, humpback dolphins found in the Indian and Pacific oceans are split into three species: <em>S. plumbea</em> (Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin), found only in the western Indian Ocean; <em>S. chinensis</em> (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin), found in the eastern Indian Ocean and throughout Southeast Asia; and <em>S. sahulensis</em> (Australian Humpback Dolphin), found off northern Australia and southern New Guinea. &#160;The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin, <em>S. teuszii</em>, is the fourth species in the genus, found only off West Africa. &#160;This view has been accepted by the Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy (Society for Marine Mammalogy 2014).<br/><br/>There are still several unresolved issues in humpback dolphin taxonomy. &#160;Humpback dolphins off Bangladesh have been assumed to correspond to <em>S. chinensis</em>, based on external appearance (primarily the shape of the dorsal fin, absence of a dorsal hump, and similar spotting patterns – see Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), but recent mtDNA genetic evidence suggests that they do not group with either <em>S. chinensis </em>or <em>S. plumbea</em>, and may in fact be more closely related phylogenetically to <em>S. sahulensis</em> (Amaral <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). &#160;Further work is needed to clarify their taxonomic status, but for this assessment they are provisionally included, with the caveat that future work may very well show them to be of a species separate from <em>S. chinensis</em>. In fact, the taxonomic affinities of humpback dolphins in the entire Bay of Bengal (i.e., eastern India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar) need to be urgently re-examined. There is also still some uncertainty regarding the exact taxonomic status of populations observed in Mainland Malaysia and Borneo (see Minton <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/>There is extensive geographic variation below the level of the species in <em>S. chinensis</em>, most of it not yet properly documented, and the validity/limits of most proposed subspecies or geographic forms are not yet well known. &#160;However, the taxonomic status of the Eastern Taiwan Strait subpopulation has recently been evaluated, and has been proposed to represent a subspecies, <em>S. chinensis taiwanensis</em> Wang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015. The nominotypological subspecies, <em>S. chinensis chinensis</em>, would then apply to all other animals in the species (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Based on molecular data, there is an undescribed <em>Glyphis </em>species currently known from Bangladesh and Malaysian Borneo (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><em></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><em></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>"

There are no reliably confirmed records of <em>M. mustelus </em>occurring north of Portuguese waters (Farrell 2010). Quignard and Capapé (1972) described a <em>M. mustelus </em>specimen from Portuguese Atlantic Ocean waters based on dermal denticle morphology and this remains the most northerly reliably identified record of this species. Similarly, some misidentification can occur between <em>M. mustelus</em> and <em>M. punctulatus</em>. This is because the black spots on the body are not unique to <em>M. punctulatus</em> and their absence is not diagnostic for <em>M. mustelus</em>. The distance of the nostrils and the shape of the mouth appear to be more useful features to distinguish the two species during fieldwork (Marino <em>et al.</em> 2018)."

Part of the confusion has been focused on two species with sessile dermic denticles (thus different from <em>C. squamosus</em>) whose most conspicuous anatomic differences are maximum size and size at sexual maturity. The species assessed here is to be considered the “smaller” species, and has been recently reported under the name of <em>C. granulosus </em>or <em>C. uyato</em>. In Australia, this species has been referred to as&#160;<em>C. zeehaani.</em><br/><br/>Taxonomic confusion comes from a long history of mistakes in the literature but also from a problem of nomenclature. A recent review by White <em>et al.</em> (2013) included a re-description and the settlement of a neotype of the “larger species” as <em>C. granulosus</em> (Bloch and Schneider 1801). Nomenclature status of this species is pending a paper in preparation that is based on classic taxonomy, review of nomenclature and genetic data, and that will also include a re-description of the species (Guallart <em>et al</em>. 2013, Veríssimo <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>At present this assessment is presented under the name <em>C. uyato</em> (Rafinesque 1810) pending this review.

There have been no recorded sightings in the Mediterranean Sea beyond the Alborán Sea in recent times, despite increasing dedicated survey effort, suggesting that the basin has no resident population of Killer Whales and is not frequented by the subpopulation of the Strait of Gibraltar (Esteban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b). Similarly, there have been no identifications of the known individuals from the Strait of Gibraltar in any of the photo-identification catalogues of resident populations outside of the Strait in Northeast Atlantic waters (Esteban&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><br/>During dedicated surveys of the Strait between 1999-2011, photo-identification records have identified 47 individuals. One adult was found dead stranded; two juveniles and five calves were not observed within their pods for at least three consecutive years and were considered dead. Consequently the population size estimate is 39, based on dedicated photo-identification data, of which 33 were re-sighted in different years (2-12 years), suggesting site fidelity to the Strait (Esteban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016c). Two groups of Killer Whales sampled off the Canary Islands were found to be the closest genetically affiliated Northeast Atlantic groups to the Strait of Gibraltar Killer Whales (Foote&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). However, in addition to the lack of photo-id matches noted above, the Canary Islands whales differed from the Strait of Gibraltar Killer Whales in their mitochondrial DNA, stable isotope ratios and contaminant loads (Esteban&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a, Jepson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Based on analysis of microsatellite loci, 1-9% of individuals in the Strait of Gibraltar were derived from the same population as the Canary Islands, whereas 9-33% of the Canary Islands individuals were derived from the same population as the Strait of Gibraltar (Esteban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a).<br/><br/>We infer these values to reflect historical connectivity between the Strait of Gibraltar and Northeast Atlantic populations, but consider the results from multiple markers (Esteban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a) of contemporary movement and migration (Esteban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a,b), to indicate that the Gibraltar whales are now geographically isolated and should be considered a subpopulation (far fewer than one migrant individual entering the subpopulation per year)."

9194,Giraffa camelopardalis,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,MAMMALIA,CETARTIODACTYLA,GIRAFFIDAE,Giraffa,camelopardalis,,,,,"(Linnaeus, 1758)","<strong>Global Notes:</strong><br/>The IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group (GOSG) currently recognizes a single species,&#160;<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>. Nine subspecies of Giraffes are currently recognized (Dagg 2014), although some authorities dispute this taxonomic classification (e.g., Groves and Grubb 2011). Several subpopulations of Giraffe, resident in northern Botswana, northwest Zimbabwe, northeastern Namibia and southwestern Zambia, are potentially either&#160;<em>G. c. angolensis</em>, or&#160;<em>G. c. giraffa</em>&#160;but the continued accumulation of information indicates that a future reassessment might be in order. Until an extensive reassessment of the taxonomic status of giraffes is completed, therefore, it is premature to alter the taxonomic&#160;<em>status quo</em>. This assessment is based upon an interim consensus that a single species of giraffes is resident on the African continent.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Taxonomic Notes for South African Regional Assessment:<br/></strong>Currently, nine subspecies classifications have been proposed for Giraffe (Ansell 1972; Dagg &amp; Foster 1982; Kingdon 1997; East 1999; Grubb 2005; Ciofolo &amp; Pendu 2013). There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the geographic and taxonomic limits of all described subspecies (Fennessy et al. 2013). Furthermore, recent genetic work suggests that several subspecies may even represent distinct species (Brown et al. 2007). Globally, only the forms <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>peralta</em> from West Africa, which recent genetic evidence has confirmed is indeed distinct (Hassanin et al. 2007), and <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>rothschildi</em> have been assessed at the subspecies level. Giraffe taxonomy of the various populations in Africa has largely been reliant on the variation of pelage pattern and geographic range. However, this has long been inconclusive. Even advances in molecular methods have left many aspects uncertain, often because of limited sampling (Fennessy et al. 2013). A good knowledge of Giraffe genetics, however, is critical for their long-term sustainable management with an estimated population of less than 80,000 remaining in the wild. In particular, the taxonomic assignment and phylogeography of two populations in southern Africa, the South African Giraffe (<em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>giraffa</em>) and the Namibian Giraffe (<em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>angolensis</em>), remains uncertain. To resolve this and estimate the divergence times among Giraffe populations, an increase in sampling effort across this region as well as more broadly across Africa is very important (Bock et al. 2014). The South African, or Cape, Giraffe was formerly classified as <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>capensis</em>. In this assessment, we treat <em>G</em>. <em>c</em>. <em>giraffa</em> as a subspecies in southern Africa (Seymour 2001; Brown et al. 2007; Dagg 2014)."

This conclusion is supported by Lorenzini and Garofalo (2015). However, recent analyses call into question the veracity of the morphology-based subspecific taxonomy of <em>C. elaphus</em> more generally. Rather, three genetic lineages were clearly differentiated corresponding approximately with geographical factors. One lineage was distributed in central-western Europe (and also Ukraine), one from eastern Europe to the Middle East, and a third which corresponded to <em>C. e. barbarus</em> and <em>C. e. corsicanus</em> from North Africa and Sardinia, the latter two nomials are considered synonyms and were recommended considered as a subspecies (Lorenzini and Garofalo 2015).

They are very similar in appearance and the genus was long considered monotypic. Two issues concerning the taxonomy of the dolphins in particular parts of the range of the genus deserve mention.<br/><br/>First, there is some uncertainty about the taxonomic status and range of Guiana Dolphins in the Orinoco River. There are frequent records of <em>Sotalia </em>at Ciudad Bolívar, some 300 km upstream from the river mouth. Such records are suspected to correspond to <em>S. guianensis</em> (da Silva and Best 1996, Meade and Koehnken 1991, Flores and da Silva 2009, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is generally assumed that <em>Sotalia </em>dolphins cannot traverse the rapids at the Casiquiare Channel, which connects the Orinoco and Amazon basins (da Silva and Best 1996). This barrier has existed since the uplift of the Mérida Cordillera (10 million years ago; Lundberg <em>et al.</em> 1998), which predates the divergence of the two species of <em>Sotalia </em>(Cunha <em>et al. </em>2005, Caballero <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2008). Thus, <em>Sotalia </em>in the Middle Orinoco are likely to be an isolated population of Guiana Dolphins (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2010). Seven animals from the Orinoco all possessed the same mitochondrial DNA sequences and had an estimated divergence from <em>S. guianensis</em> of 640,000 years ago (Caballero <em>et al</em>. 2017). Caballero <em>et al.</em> (2017) suggested that the Orinoco River animals belong to an independent population unit isolated from other coastal populations and worthy of separate conservation and management efforts.<br/><br/>The second issue relates to the taxonomic status of <em>Sotalia </em>dolphins from the southern freshwater portion of Maracaibo Lake. Those individuals are morphologically different from the marine <em>Sotalia </em>that inhabit the northern portion of the lake, adjacent to the Gulf of Venezuela. Dolphins from southern Maracaibo are smaller than marine <em>Sotalia</em> and about the same size as <em>S. fluviatilis </em>(Casinos <em>et al.</em> 1981, da Silva and Best 1996, León 2005). However, there is no connection between Maracaibo Lake and the known present-day range of riverine <em>Sotalia</em>, and the lake has been isolated from the Amazon basin for the last 8-10 million years (Hoorn <em>et al. </em>1995, Días de Gamero 1996 cited in Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2010). The morphological distinctiveness of the southern Maracaibo Lake <em>Sotalia</em> population could be a result of phenotypic plasticity, unlike the difference between <em>S. guianensis </em>and <em>S. fluviatilis</em>. However, it may also indicate a lack of gene flow with the marine <em>Sotalia </em>from the mouth of the lake and the Gulf of Venezuela. Indeed, Caballero <em>et al.</em> (2006) observed some exclusive haplotypes in samples from the lake, but they did not consider this to signify a species-level difference. All haplotypes in Maracaibo Lake were <em>S</em>. <em>guianensis </em>(Caballero <em>et al</em>. 2017) with one of those being most closely related to the single haplotype found in the Orinoco River. Both of the populations here—in Maracaibo Lake and the Orinoco River—would meet the IUCN definition of a subpopulation.</p>"

It was formerly regarded as a pygmy form of Bryde’s Whale (<em>B. brydei/edeni</em>), but it is not closely related to that group, lying outside the clade formed by the Sei Whale (<em>B. borealis</em>) and two forms of Bryde's Whales). The morphology of Omura’s Whale is quite distinct from those of Bryde’s Whales and other known baleen whales, but its colouration resembles that of the Fin Whale (<em>B. physalus</em>) while lacking lateral rostral ridges (Wada <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>To date (December 2017), the only genetically confirmed observations of living Omura’s Whales are of 18 biopsied individuals in an apparently resident population off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Specimens collected in 1976 in the Solomon Sea (Ohsumi 1978) and in 1978 in the eastern Indian Ocean (Ohsumi 1980) were originally taken under a scientific permit for Bryde’s Whales and were subsequently genetically identified as Omura’s Whales (Wada<em> et al</em>. 2003). LeDuc and Dizon (2002) genetically analysed specimens of small “Bryde’s Whales” from the Bohol Sea, Philippines, and found that they segregated phylogenetically outside the Sei/Bryde’s Whale clade and basal to <em>B. edeni/B. borealis</em>. From a comparison of the published phylogenies, Sasaki<em> et al</em>. (2006) concluded that these specimens corresponded to Omura’s Whale. Yamada <em>et al. </em>(2008) identified 24 skulls from a whaling operation in the Philippines as Omura’s Whales."

Based on genetics there is substantial population structure, both between and within-ocean basins, and even within a single archipelago (Martien <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014). This species has been intensively studied only in Hawaii (Baird 2016) and more recently in New Zealand (Zaeschmar 2014). In Hawaii, three subpopulations have been identified based on a combination of genetic studies (Martien <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014), satellite tagging (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2010, 2012, 2014, Bradford <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2014a), and analyses of photo-identification data (Baird <em>et al</em><span class=""datalabel1"">. 2008, Baird 2016). These include two partially overlapping insular populations, one around the main Hawaiian Islands, and one in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, as well as a partially overlapping pelagic population that ranges throughout and beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Archipelago. In New Zealand, based on high resighting rates of photo-identified individuals and a relatively small number of individuals documented, it is likely that this represents a distinct subpopulation (Zaeschmar 2014). While the number of subpopulations world-wide is unknown, this is due primarily to incomplete sampling in most of the range.

Animals in the North Pacific are similar in size and morphology to North Atlantic Blue Whales and are also regarded as<em> B. m. musculus</em>, pending a genetic comparison of these populations. The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em> is distinguished by its large body size and Antarctic distribution in summer. The Pygmy Blue Whale <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has a number of morphological characteristics that distinguish it from <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and <em>B. m. musculus</em>. It occurs in the Indian Ocean, excluding the Antarctic, from Africa and Madagascar across to Indonesia and Australia, and in the southwestern Pacific, including Tasmania and New Zealand. Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean have been tentatively assigned the name<em> B. m. indica</em>, but a clear distinction between <em>B. m. indica </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> has not yet been established.<br/><br/>Blue Whales in the southeastern Pacific are intermediate in size between <em>B. m. intermedia</em> and<em> B. m. brevicauda</em> (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and are genetically differentiated from both groups (LeDuc<em> et al.</em> 2017). They are provisionally designated as an unnamed subspecies with the common name Chilean Blue Whales. Chilean Blue Whales are genetically most similar to Blue Whales in the northeast Pacific (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2017); investigations into the genetic and morphological distinction between these two groups are ongoing. The respective winter ranges of Blue Whales from the eastern South Pacific (Chilean Blue whales) and from the eastern North Pacific may overlap in the eastern equatorial Pacific but their breeding seasons are probably six months out of phase (LeDuc<em> et al</em>. 2017)."

The Common Bottlenose Dolphin has a worldwide distribution in tropical and temperate latitudes but exhibits a strong ability to adapt to local conditions, a complex social structure and strong site fidelity which results in considerable habitat partitioning throughout its range. This, in turn, has created strong population differentiation accompanied, in some cases, by marked morphological differentiation. The taxonomy of Bottlenose Dolphins is confused due to this geographical variation, and it is very possible that additional species will be recognized in the future.<br/><br/>Three subspecies are currently recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy (2017) and a recent re-assessment of <em>Tursiops </em>taxonomy worldwide conducted by the International Whaling Commission confirmed their validity (IWC 2018). These subspecies are the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>T. t. ponticus</em>&#160;Barabash-Nikiforov, 1940) which differs morphologically and genetically from other forms including those in the nearby Mediterranean Sea (Barabash-Nikiforov 1960, Geptner <em>et al.</em> 1976, Natoli <em>et al. </em>2005, Viaud-Martinez <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Lahille Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>T. t. gephyreus</em>) (Lahille, 1908), a larger form in the coastal waters of the western South Atlantic Ocean, is morphologically and genetically different from the offshore population in eastern South America (Costa <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016; Fruet <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). The third subspecies is the nominate subspecies that includes the remaining Common Bottlenose Dolphins worldwide (<em>T. t. truncatus&#160;</em>(Montagu, 1821)). In the western North Atlantic, two forms, offshore and coastal, are distinguishable on the basis of morphology and ecological markers (Mead and Potter 1995) and have fixed genetic differences (Le Duc and Curry 1997, Hoelzel <em>et al. </em>1998, Kingston <em>et al. </em>2009, Rosel<em> et al.</em> 2009, Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017a) and according to the recent IWC review the coastal population should be recognized as at least a different subspecies."

Cuvier in Lesson (1828), rather than to Lesson (1828) (Smeenk 2018). The latter attribution (Lesson, 1828) is now followed by the Committee on Taxonomy (2020).<br/><br/><u>Justification of a Mediterranean subpopulation of Rough-toothed Dolphin (</u><em style=""text-decoration-line: underline;"">Steno bredanensis</em><u>)<br/></u>This text addresses two definitions of a species’ subpopulation, taken from the Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2019) and the website of the IUCN Red List, to show how Rough-toothed Dolphin in the Mediterranean meets these definitions:<br/><br/>1. <em>Geographically separate subpopulations of a species are defined as those populations that are so isolated from others of the same species that it is considered extremely unlikely that there is any genetic interchange. In general, listings of such subpopulations should be restricted to those that have been isolated for a long period of time.<br/></em>Evidence gathered from dedicated surveys and opportunistic sightings over the last 45 years show the Rough-toothed Dolphin to be restricted in the Mediterranean Sea to the central and eastern parts of the basin, and within this area to maintain two seemingly disparate fragments, one in the Levant Basin (westernmost sighting off north-western Cyprus) and the second in the Ionian Sea (westernmost record in Donnalucata, Sicily) (Kerem&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). As of today, there are 27 records from the former and six from the latter. The closest Atlantic resident population is around Madeira Island, Portugal (Alves <em>et al. </em>2018), roughly 3,000 km west of Donnalucata. The distance could theoretically be covered over a month of continuous straight travel (Wells <em>et al. </em>2008) but should be considered extremely unlikely.<br/><br/>The lack of sightings in the western Mediterranean Sea cannot be passed over by a dearth of survey effort. On the contrary, the Alboran Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar have been extensively surveyed over the last decades with no records of the species (A. Cañadas and R. de Stephanis pers. comm. September 2015).<br/><br/>The distance to the northernmost record of Rough-toothed Dolphin in the Red Sea (Eritrea; Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017) is about 2,000 km, but all Levantine DNA sequences differ markedly from Indian Ocean (Oman) ones.<br/><br/>2. <em>Geographically or otherwise distinct groups in the population between which there is little demographic or genetic exchange (typically one successful migrant individual or gamete per year or less).</em></p><p>There is at present not a sufficiently large genetic database from which to calculate migration rates. Preliminary genetic evidence suggests an Atlantic origin of the Mediterranean subpopulation with long separation (see Population section). Tissue samples from the Ionian fragment were not included in the above-mentioned preliminary analysis, yet all three Levantine sequences had private alleles.</p>"

The delegates of the Workshop on Caprinae Taxonomy (IUCN/SSC Caprinae Specialist Group 2000) disagreed with such classification, partly because of differences in the number of chromosomes (i.e., mouflon 54 and Urial 58), and concluded that Mouflon and Urial are different species. A molecular study (Rezaei <em>et al.</em> 2010) showed that the individuals identified as mouflon and Urial form two strongly monophyletic groups. Individuals sampled from hybrid populations appear either in the clade of Urial or in that of mouflon. Considering these two taxa as distinct species would be coherent with the morphological and genetic differences between them, as well as, their past evolutionary divergence, and the occurrence of a hybrid zone (Rezaei <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>The name <em>O. orientalis</em> has first been used to designate the hybrid red sheep, found in Iran (listed as <em>O. o. orientalis</em> on page 13 of the IUCN Caprinae Action Plan). This sheep is considered a hybrid form, the result of interbreeding of Mouflon and Urial. Therefore the name <em>O. orientalis</em> is <em>nomen nudum</em>. Following on chronology, the next valid name for the Asiatic mouflons should be <em>O.</em> <em>gmelini</em> Blyth, 1841; and for the Urial should be <em>O.</em> <em>vignei</em> Blyth, 1841. Both CITES and the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) use <em>O. vignei</em> for the Urial as also suggested by Rezaei <em>et al</em>.

In addition to problems with identifying different subspecies several local populations of Urial may be currently classified to a “wrong” subspecies (IUCN SSC/Caprinae Specialist Group 2000).</p>"

The morphological differences between <em>D. delphis </em>and <em>D. capensis</em> in the North Pacific (Heyning and Perrin 1994) were supported by molecular evidence from both mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Rosel<em> et al.</em> 1994). However, the genus exhibits a great deal of morphological variation globally and the criteria used to distinguish between the two species in the North Pacific appear not to apply elsewhere (Best 2007). In South Africa, Samaai <em>et al. </em>(2005) found that based on skull morphology the majority of specimens belonged to<em> D. capensis</em>, however two specimens were within the range for<em> D. delphis</em> from the North Pacific, and a third specimen fell between the ranges for<em> D. delphis </em>and <em>D. capensis </em>(Samaai<em> et al.</em> 2005). The same molecular markers that were used to differentiate the two sympatric species in the North Pacific failed to reveal any genetic distinction between the described morphotypes in South Africa (Best 2007).<br/><br/>Subsequently, Cunha <em>et al.</em> (2015), in a global analysis of <em>Delphinus</em> which included nine specimens from the west coast of South Africa (eastern South Atlantic), concluded that all specimens analysed from the Atlantic Ocean belonged to <em>D. delphis, </em>and that<em> D. capensis</em> was not a genetically valid species.<br/><br/>In 2016 the Society for Marine Mammalogy Committee on Taxonomy removed <em>Delphinus capensis</em> from its accepted list of marine mammal species and now recognises all Common Dolphins globally as belonging to a single species, <em>Delphinus delphis</em> (Committee on Taxonomy 2020). It recognises the following subspecies:</p>  <ul>  <li><em>D. d. delphis&#160;</em>Linnaeus, 1758. Common Dolphin</li>  <li><em>D. d. bairdii&#160;</em>Dall, 1873.

Indo-Pacific Common Dolphin</li> </ul>  <p>Cunha <em>et al.</em> (2015) noted that because the sympatric or parapatric Long-beaked and Short-beaked Common Dolphins off California in the eastern North Pacific appear not to interbreed, the Long-beaked Common Dolphins might eventually be described and recognised as a separate species,&#160;<em>D. bairdii.</em> Some researchers have considered the Long-beaked Common Dolphins in the Indo-Pacific, which has an exceptionally long beak, to constitute a separate species, <em>D. tropicalis</em> (Van Bree and Gallagher 1978; Rice 1998). However, another morphometric study concluded that that form should be considered a subspecies (Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2002) and it is currently recognised as such,&#160;<em>D. delphis tropicalis.</em><br/><br/>The non-concordance of morphological and genetic data for Common Dolphins has caused much confusion and a rigorous global taxonomic study of the genus is needed.
